    <!-- By using the pair of latitudes and longitudes measurements, I made a simple kml document which marks the general path that was taken for the first circumnavigation of the world.  Due to only having 10 pairs of longitude and latitude measurements, for the coordinates for the Cape of Good Hope, Cape of Malacca, and the Cape of Eleven Thousand Virgins, I used the latitude measurement given in the text and then I used the modern longitude line because of the inability to measure longitude in certian cases.  I also used the modern coordinates for Seville to mark the beginning and the end of the journey  -->

    <description>When we had gone out of this strait, if we had always navigated to the west we should have gone without finding any land except the Cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, which is the eastern head of the strait in the ocean sea, with the Cape of Desire at the west in the Pacific sea.
        These two capes are exactly in fifty-two degrees of latitude of the antarctic pole.

                Constrained by extreme necessity, we decided on touching at the Cape Verde Islands, and on Wednesday the 9th of July, we touched at one of those islands named St. James's.
                Knowing that we were in an enemy's country, and amongst suspicious persons, on sending the boat ashore to get provision of victuals, we charged the seamen to say to the Portuguese that we had sprung our foremast under the equinoctial line (although this misfortune had happened at the Cape of Good Hope), and that our ship was alone, because whilst we tried to repair it, our captain-general had gone with the other two ships to Spain.
                With these good words, and giving some of our merchandise in exchange, we obtained two boat-loads of rice. </description>
