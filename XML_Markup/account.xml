            she parted company with the <name>"Victoria"</name>.</title>
        <author>From Navarrete.</author></header>
    <body><p> After the <name>Victoria</name> left <placeName>Tidore</placeName>, the crew of the
                <name>Trinity</name> commenced careening their ship, and took out of her and placed
            in the store-house in <placeName>Tidore</placeName> their goods and the guns of the
                <name>Conception</name>, which they had burned, and of the
                <placeName>Santiago</placeName>, which was lost. <persName>Gonzalo Gomez de
                Espinosa</persName> determined to leave in charge of these goods and factory the
            accountant, <persName>Juan de Campos</persName>, as clerk; the <rank>officer</rank>,
                <persName>Luis del Molino</persName>; the <rank>servants</rank>, <persName>Alonso de
                Cota</persName>, <persName>Genoese</persName>, and <persName>Diego Arias</persName>;
            and <persName>Master Pedro</persName>, a bombardier. Taking leave of the
                <rank>King</rank> of <placeName>Tidore</placeName>, the <name>Trinity</name> sailed
            thence on the <date when="04-06-1522">6th of April 1522</date>, with fifty men on the
            muster-roll, and a cargo of nine hundred quintals of cloves. The <name>Trinity</name>
            sailed for forty leagues to an island named <placeName>Zanufo</placeName>, in <geo
                lat="2">2 deg. 30 min. N. latitude</geo>, belonging to the <rank>King</rank> of
                <placeName>Tidore</placeName>, thence to the open sea, where they calculated they
            had two thousand leagues to run to <placeName>Panama</placeName>. In <geo lat="20">20
                deg.</geo> they fell in with an island, where they took in a native, and continuing
            a northerly course to <geo lat="42">42 deg.</geo>, they met with a storm which lasted
            five days, and they had to cut away the castle at the prow; their poop was broken; their
            mainmast was broken in two. The crews fell sick, and they returned to seek the island
            from which they had taken the native; but, not being able to fetch it, they arrived at
            another <geo lat="20">twenty leagues</geo> distant from it. This island was named
                <placeName>Mao</placeName>, and is to the north of the island
                <placeName>Botaha</placeName>; they are in <geo lat="12" lon="13">12 deg. and 13
                deg.</geo> This island was three hundred leagues from the
                <placeName>Moluccas</placeName>, and they were a month and a half in getting there;
            many of the crew died. When they arrived and anchored at the first land, which was
                <placeName>Zanufo</placeName>, a vessel passed by which informed them that a
            fortnight after the <name>Trinity</name> sailed, five or seven
                <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup> sail had arrived at
                <placeName>Terrenate</placeName>, whose captain was <persName>Antonio de
                Brito</persName>, and that they were building a fortress there.
                <persName>Barros</persName> states that the first stone of this was placed by
                <persName>Antonio de Brito</persName>
            <date when="06-24-1522">June 24th, 1522</date>. The captain of the <name>Trinity</name>
            begged the people of this vessel to take a man to <placeName>Terrenate</placeName>, who
            was <persName>Bartolome Sanchez</persName>, the <rank>clerk</rank> of the ship, by whom
            he sent a letter to the <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup>
            <rank>captain</rank>, begging him, on the part of His <rank>Majesty</rank>, to send him
            succour to prevent the ship being lost, for his crew was sick and reduced in number.
                <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName>, seeing that this was delayed, weighed, and came
            to anchor in the port of <placeName>Benaconora</placeName>. <persName>Simon
                Abreu</persName>, and <persName>Duarte Roger</persName>, <rank>clerk</rank> of the
                <rank>King</rank> of <placeName>Portugal</placeName>'s factory, came there, with
            other people, in a caracora, and after that came a fusta and caravel, with other armed
                <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup>, who entered the <name>Trinity</name>, and
            gave to the <rank>captain</rank> a letter from <persName>Antonio de Brito</persName> in
            answer to his, dated <date when="10-21-1522">October 21st, 1522</date>, which only said
            that people were going to bring in his ship. By an order which they brought from Antonio
            Brito, they at once took from <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName> all the letters,
            astrolabes, quadrants, and log-books which he had made; they took the vessel and
            anchored her in the port of <placeName>Talangomi</placeName>. There were seventeen
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> of sound and sick in the vessel, and they took
            those that were well with <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName> to the fortress, and next
            day took the sick to the hospital. <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName> complained of the
            violence done in taking that which belonged to the <rank>emperor</rank>, and in his
            country. They replied that he had done what the <rank>emperor</rank>, his
                <rank>lord</rank>, had commanded him; and they, what they ought to do by the
            instructions from the <rank>king</rank>, their <rank>lord</rank>. They asked him to give
            up the royal standard of <placeName>Castile</placeName>, and he answered that he could
            not do so, neither could he defend it, since he was in their power. Upon which they drew
            up some documents before a notary; and when they discharged the cargo of the ship, he
            asked the <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup> to give him a certificate of what was in
            it, for him to render an account to His <rank>Majesty</rank>; and they replied that, if
            he asked for this often, they would give it him on a yard arm. In the fortress we found
                <persName>Juan de Campos</persName>, <persName>Diego Arias</persName>, and
                <persName>Alonzo</persName>, the <ethnicGroup>Genoese</ethnicGroup>, sick, who were
            three of those who had remained in <placeName>Tidore</placeName> with the goods of His
                <rank>Majesty</rank>. They said that the <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup> had
            knocked down the factory-house and taken the cloves and receipts for cloves which were
            paid for, and all the rigging and fittings of the ships; <persName>Luis del
                Molino</persName> had fled, and <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName> called him to
            come to the fortress under safe conduct, but when in it they put him in irons;
                <persName>Master Pedro</persName> had died. When the ship was in
                <placeName>Tidore</placeName>, the <rank>pilot</rank>, <persName>Juan Lopes
                Carvalho</persName>, died on the <date when="02-14-1522">14th February, 1522</date>;
            and, between sailing thence and anchoring at <placeName>Benaconora</placeName>, there
            died in August, September, and October, thirty-one individuals, without counting three
            who ran away in the isle of Mao of the Ladrones. The twenty-one
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> of the ship and factory remained about four
            months as prisoners in <placeName>Terrenate</placeName>, until, at the end of <date
                when="02-1523">February 1523</date>, <rank>Captain</rank>
            <persName>Antonio de Brito</persName> gave them a passage to
                <placeName>India</placeName>, sending them to the island of
                <placeName>Banda</placeName>, which was a hundred leagues off, excepting the
            carpenter <persName>Antonio</persName>, and the caulker <persName>Antonio
                Basazaval</persName>, whom he said that he required. The clerk of the factory,
                <persName>Juan de Campos</persName>, and three other
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup>, went in a junk, of which nothing was known
            nor what became of those persons. The <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> remained in
                <placeName>Banda</placeName> about four months; from thence they were conducted to
                <placeName>Java</placeName>, and coasting it they arrived at a city named
                <placeName>Agrazue</placeName>. <placeName>Agrazue</placeName> was a town of thirty
            thousand inhabitants, <ethnicGroup>Mussulmans</ethnicGroup>, of great trade, to which
            porcelain, silks, and other <ethnicGroup>Chinese</ethnicGroup> goods were brought from
                <placeName>Borneo</placeName> and other parts. From <placeName>Agrazue</placeName>
            they went to <placeName>Malacca</placeName>, two hundred leagues distant, where
                <persName>Jorge de Albuquerque</persName> was <rank>captain</rank>. They were about
            five months at <placeName>Malacca</placeName>. Four
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> died there at the end of <date when="11-1524"
                >November 1524</date>, The ship-boy, <persName>Anton Moreno</persName>, remained
            there, who was, they said, the slave of a sister of <persName>Jorge de
                Albuquerque</persName>, and the rest went on to <placeName>India</placeName>. They
            were twenty-five days in reaching <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, which was three hundred
            leagues, and they went a hundred leagues more to <placeName>Cochin</placeName>. The
            clerk, <persName>Bartolomé Sanchez</persName>, and two others, went in a junk, of which
            nothing more was heard. In <placeName>Cochin</placeName> they found that the ships for
                <placeName>Portugal</placeName> had sailed a short time before their arrival, and
            they had to wait a year for the passage of the spice ships. After they had been ten
            months in <placeName>Cochin</placeName>, without obtaining leave to embark, the seaman,
                <persName>Leon Pancaldo</persName>, and <persName>Bautista Poncero</persName>,
            master of the ship <name>Trinity</name>, fled secretly in the ship <name>Sta.
                Catallna</name>, which left them in <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>. There they
            were arrested and put on board the ship of <name>Diego de Melo</name> to be taken to the
                <rank>Governor</rank> of <placeName>India</placeName>, but contrary winds did not
            permit her departure; and, having been allowed to go ashore, <persName>Bautista
                Poncero</persName> died, and <persName>Leon Pancaldo</persName> hid himself in the
            ship of <name>Francisco Pereira</name>, which was going to Portugal. He remained hid
            till they got a hundred leagues from <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>, When they
            arrived at <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> they put him in prison, from which the king
            commanded him to be set free. At this time, <persName>D. Vasco da Gama</persName>
            arrived in <placeName>India</placeName> as <rank>Viceroy</rank>, and the
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> begged for leave to embark in the ships which
            were going to <placeName>Portugal</placeName>, but he would not give it. The
                <rank>Viceroy</rank> died in twenty days, and they elected in his stead <persName>D.
                Enrique de Meneses</persName> governor of <placeName>Goa</placeName>, who came to
                <placeName>Cochin</placeName>. Two <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup> died there,
            and those that remained had to wait for another year. <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName>
            had done homage and could not get away until after constant recourse and petitions to
            the <rank>governor</rank>, <persName>D. Enrique de Meneses</persName>, who gave him
            leave, as also to the seaman, <persName>Gines de Mafra</persName>, and to
                <persName>Master Hans</persName>, a bombardier, when it was known there that the
                <rank>King</rank> of Portugal was married to <persName>Da. Catalina</persName>,
            sister of His Majesty the Emperor, These three individuals left
                <placeName>Cochin</placeName> in the <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup> ships,
            and when they arrived at <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> they put them in the
                <placeName>Limoneiro</placeName> or public prison, where <rank>Master</rank>
            <persName>Hans</persName> died. <persName>Gonzalo Gomez</persName> and <persName>Gines
                de Mafra</persName> remained there about seven months, until they were set free by
            letters from His <rank>Majesty</rank>; but Gonzalo Gomez<ref n="1">1</ref> was set free twenty-seven
            days before <persName>Gines</persName>, whom they supposed to be a pilot, having found
            some log-books in his box and two other (books), which <persName>Andres de San
                Martin</persName>, pilot of His <rank>Majesty</rank>, had made, which books and
            other writings they took, and would not return to him. From their departure from
                <placeName>Terrenate</placeName>, in the <placeName>Moluccas</placeName>, to
                <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>, inclusively, there died eight individuals. What
            became of seven was unknown; two remained in the <placeName>Moluccas</placeName>; one in
                <placeName>Malacca</placeName>; and three reached <placeName>Spain</placeName>,
            besides the licentiate and priest, <persName>Morales</persName>. <persName>Gaspar
                Correa</persName> says (tome iii, p. 109):— "In this year <date when="1527"
                >1527</date>, one <persName>Sebastian Gabato</persName>, a
                <ethnicGroup>Basque</ethnicGroup>, and a great pilot, sailed from
                <placeName>Seville</placeName> as <rank>captain-major</rank> of two ships and a
            caravel, who was ordered by the <rank>Viceroy</rank> of the
                <placeName>Antilles</placeName> to go and take in cargo at
                <placeName>Maluco</placeName>, and recover the property of the
                <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup>, which he might find belonging to the ship of
            the fleet of <persName>Fernan de Magalhāes</persName> which put in in distress; and if
            he found any things in the possession of the <ethnicGroup>Portuguese</ethnicGroup>, he
            was to ask for them and require them from the <rank>captains</rank> on behalf of the <rank>emperor</rank>, with
            all urbanity: and if they did not choose to give them up, he was to ask for documents,
            with protests, which he was to bring to the <rank>emperor</rank> for him to do in the matter what
            might be for his service. This fleet sailed from <placeName>Seville</placeName>, and never more was any news
            heard of what became of it, nor what end it had. This only was known, that this fleet
            had thus sailed this year, through other <ethnicGroup>Castilians</ethnicGroup>, who later arrived at <placeName>Maluco</placeName> in
            another fleet, as I will relate further on in its place."</p>
        <p> [<persName>Correa</persName> relates, in his Tom. iii, cap. xiv, that <persName>Charles V</persName> sent a fleet of five ships in
            <date when="1527">1527</date> to <placeName>Maluco</placeName> under <persName>Fray Garcia de Loaysa</persName>, that only one ship under <persName>Captain Martim</persName>
            Inhigo reached <placeName>Maluco</placeName>: he then describes the disputes and skirmishes between the
