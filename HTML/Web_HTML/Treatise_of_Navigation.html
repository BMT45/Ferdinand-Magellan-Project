         TREATISE OF NAVIGATION
         
         OF THE
         
         CHEVALIER <span class="persName">ANTONY PIGAFETTA</span>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>The armillary sphere, of which the author gives a drawing, serves to explain the system
            of the world according to Ptolemy, and could also serve as an astrolabe, for one sees
            at the 
            top of it a kind of handle or ring, by which to hold it suspended, as is seen in the
            above-mentioned drawing. He begins his treatise by giving us an idea of that system,
            as have done 
            all those after him, who have written of the elements of the nautical art and of pilotage.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"The earth is round," he says, "and remains suspended and immovable in the midst of all the celestial bodies. The
            first index fixed on two poles, the arctic and antarctic, which are 
            supposed to correspond with the poles of the earth. It runs from East to West, and
            transports with itself all the planets and stars. Besides this there is the eighth
            sphere, the 
            poles of which are at 23 deg. 33 min.,<sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> it runs from West to East.
         </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p>"It is supposed that all the circumference of the earth is divided into 360 degrees; and each degree is of 17 leagues and a half, consequently the circumference of the earth is 
            6,300 leagues. Land leagues are of three miles and sea leagues of four miles.<sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> "The ten circles of the armillary sphere, of which the six major pass through the
            center of the 
            earth, serve to determine the situation of countries and climates. The Ecliptic determines the movement of the sun and the planets: the two Tropics indicate the point to which the 
            sun declines from the equator towards the North in summer, and towards the South in
            winter. The Meridian, always variable, because it passes through all points of the equator, 
            cutting it perpendicularly, designates the longitude, and it is on it that the latitudes
            are marked."
         </p>
         
         Of Latitude.
         
         
         
         <p>After having well explained the armillary sphere with all its parts, and their use
            according to the system of Ptolemy, the author goes on to teach the method of 
            taking the altitude of the pole, on which the latitude is calculated; fixing the pole
            at 0° and the equator at 90°.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"The Polar star," he says, "is not precisely on the point corresponding to the axis of the earth; but it turns
            round it, as do all the other stars. In order to know its 
            true position with regard to the pole, it must be observed where the Guard stars <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> stand. If these are on the western arm, <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> the polar star stands one degree above the 
            pole: if they are on the line <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> the pole star stands 3 deg. 30 min. <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> below the pole: if they are on the eastern arm the pole star is one degree below the pole. When one 
            wishes to take the altitude of the pole star, in whichever of the above-mentioned
            four places the Guard stars may be, the degrees which the pole star has above the pole will 
            be subtracted from its altitude, or those which it has below the pole will be added
            to it. I have spoken in the account of the voyage of the stars of the Antarctic Pole.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"The latitude of the place may also be ascertained by the sun's altitude. 
            1. If you find yourself between the equinoctial and the arctic pole and the shadow
            falls towards 
            that pole, look how many degrees and minutes meridianal declination the sun has that
            day; and this you will subtract from the altitude of the sun which you have taken:
            
            afterwards, deducting the remaining degrees from 90 deg., you will have in the residue
            the number of degrees of North latitude, that is your distance from the equator.
            2. If the sun has a boreal declination, in such a manner that the shadow falls towards
            the south, take the sun's declination on that day, and add it to the sun's altitude
            
            which you have taken, from that sum subtract 90 degs., and the remaining degrees will
            indicate your boreal latitude. 
            3. If the sun is between the equinoctial and the antarctic, 
            and the shadow falls towards the antarctic, observe the sun's declination for that
            day, subtract it from the altitude taken, according to the first rule, and you will
            have the 
            degrees of south latitude. 
            4. If, when you and the sun are between the equinoctial and the antarctic pole, the
            shadow falls towards the north, you will add the altitude you have 
            taken to the sun's declination that day, and act according to the second rule. 
            5. When you have an altitude of 90 deg., you will be so many degrees distant from
            the equator as 
            there are degrees of the sun's declination, and if the sun has no declination you
            will be under the equator. 
            6. If you are to the north of the equator, and the sun is in the 
            southern signs you will look what is its declination, you will add these degrees of
            declination to those of the altitude observed, and as many degrees as are wanting
            from 90 
            deg., so many will you be distant from the equinoctial. 
            7. You will do the same when you find yourself to the south of the equinoctial, whilst
            the sun is in the northern signs.
         </p>
         
         "Of Longitude.
         
         
         <p>"Longitude indicates the degrees from east to west: I have considered many methods or means for ascertaining it, and I have found three
            methods <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> fitting for that object. 
            The last is the most convenient for those who do not know astrology. At the present
            time the pilots content themselves with knowing the latitude; and are so proud that
            they 
            will not hear speak of longitude.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"i. From the latitude of the moon the longitude is calculated of the place in which
            the observation is made. The distance of the moon from the ecliptic is called its
            latitude: 
            the ecliptic is the path of the sun. The moon, in its movement, always increases its
            distance until it reaches the furthest point of its distance: and thence it returns
            back, 
            to diminish, so to say, its latitude, until it is with the head or tail of the dragon
            <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> there it cuts the ecliptic. And since the moon, whilst it lengthens its distance
            from 
            the ecliptic, has more degrees towards the west than towards the east, it must necessarily
            have more latitude on one side (of the globe) than on the other: and when the latitude
            
            is known, by measuring the degrees and minutes with the astrolabe, it will be known
            whether it is found, and how far it is found towards the east or the west. But in
            order to 
            ascertain the longitude, you must know in what latitude the moon ought to be at that
            same moment in the place from which you sailed, for instance, in Seville. By knowing the 
            latitude and longitude of the moon at Seville in degrees and minutes, and seeing also the latitude and longitude which it has in
            the place where you are, you will know how many 
            hours and minutes you are distant from Seville; and afterwards you will calculate the distance in east or west longitude.
            
            "ii. The moon furnishes another method for ascertaining the longitude, but that is
            when I knew the precise hour in which the moon observed at Seville ought to be in conjunction 
            with a given star or planet, or ought to be in a certain opposition to the sun, of
            which the degrees are determined: and this I can know by means of an almanack. And
            since that 
            happens in the east before it happens in the west, as many as may be the hours and
            minutes that may elapse from the time when the conjunction took place at Seville, till the time 
            in which I observe it to take place, so much will be my longitude west of Seville. But if I should see the conjunction take place before the hour in which it ought
            to happen with 
            respect to Seville, then my distance in longitude will be east. For each hour, fifteen
            degrees of longitude are calculated.
            
            "To understand this does not require any great genius. It should be borne in mind
            that the moon has a motion opposed to the general motion of the heavens; that is,
            it goes from 
            west to east, and in every two hours it progresses a degree and a few minutes; and
            since it is in the first heaven, and the stars are in the eighth, it certainly never
            enters in 
            conjunction with them; but sometimes it interposes itself before the rays which come
            from them to our eye: but this does not happen at the same time to those who are at
            Seville, 
            and to those who are at Valencia. The annexed figure will give an idea of this, from
            which it is seen that the ray of the star d is intercepted by the moon c for those
            who are at 
            a and not for those who are at b for whom it was intercepted when the moon was at
            e.

            "iii. The compass can also supply a method, still easier, for finding the longitude
            of the place in which you are. It is known that the compass, or the magnetised needle
            which is 
            in it, directs itself to a given point, because of the tendency which the loadstone
            has towards the pole. The reason of this tendency is because the loadstone does not
            find in the 
            heavens any other spot in repose except the pole, and on that account directs itself
            towards it. This is an explanation of the phenomenon which I propose; and I believe
            it to be 
            true, so long as experience does not inform us of some better explanation.
            
            "In order to know, by means of the needle, the degrees of longitude, form a large
            circle, in which place the compass, and divide it into 360 deg.: and having placed
            the needle at 
            360 deg., where it indicates the arctic pole; when the needle is in repose, draw a
            thread, which should pass from the arctic pole, pointed out by the needle to the antarctic
            pole, 
            and let this thread be longer than the diameter. After that take the south, which
            you will know by the greatest altitude of the sun. Turn the compass, until the thread
            which 
            traverses it coincides with the direction of the meridian shade; then, from the antarctic
            pole of the needle, with the thread which remained over, draw another thread to the
            
            arctic pole, that is, to the flower; <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> and you will thus find how many degrees the needle of the compass is distant from
            the meridian line, that is, from the true pole. So many 
            will be the degrees of longitude, which you will have from the place where the compass
            begins to set itself in motion. <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> Therefore, with the more accuracy you take the true 
            meridian so much the more exactly will you be able to ascertain the degrees of longitude.
            And from this it may be seen that the meridian should never be taken with the compass,
            
            because it north-easts or north-wests, <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> as soon as it goes out of the true meridian; but take an observation of the south
            <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> with the astrolabe, and judge that it is midday 
            when the sun is at its greatest height.
            
            "If it is not possible to take the sun's altitude at midday, that can be determined
            with an hour-glass of sand, taking the hours of the night from sunset till the moment
            of its 
            rising. Having learned the hours of the night, you will know how many are wanting of the twenty-four, and these you will divide into two equal parts. When half of this has elapsed, 
            be sure that it is midday, and that the shadow indicates to you the true meridian.
            But since the sand clock may often be inexact, it will be better to take the sun's
            altitude with 
            the astrolabe by means of its mediclino. <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup>
            
            "The true meridian may also be ascertained, or rather the equinoctial line, which
            cuts the meridian at right angles, by observing the points where the sun rises and
            sets, and by 
            observing how much they are distant from the equinoctial either to the north or to
            the south. For this purpose an astrolabe is formed with the globe; that is, a circle
            is made 
            representing the earth's circumference, divided into 360 deg. At sunrise fix two pins
            in the circumference, in such a manner that a line drawn from one to the other should
            pass 
            through the centre, and place the pins so that both should be in a line opposite the
            sun's center. Place two other pins in the same way in the circumference when the sun
            sets. 
            You will thus see how much the sun declines from the equinoctial line, either to the
            north or to the south. And as many degrees as the pins are distant from the equinoctial,
            so 
            many degrees the the sun's declination. Having found the sun's rising and setting,
            you will also find the medium distance; that is, the meridian line, and afterwards
            you will see 
            how much the compass or magnetic needle north-easts or north-wests. You will infer
            from this how far you are from the Fortunate islands; that is, from Tenerife towards
            the east or 
            the west. This method has been tried by experience.<sup><span class="ref"></span></sup></p>
         
         "Direction of the Ship.
         
         
         <p>"If you wish to navigate to any place, you must first know its position; that is,
            its latitude and longitude. Then, by means of the compass you will point directly
            to that place. 
            And since the compass varies to east and west, you must, by the methods above described,
            ascertain its variation, and subtract or add that which is necessary, so that the
            ship's 
            head, regulated by the compass, may have the required direction.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"Should the compass be lost, or if its variation east or west is not known, you may
            regulate yourself by the sun at midday. When you have fixed the meridian in such a
            manner that 
            it cuts the ship in its width, it will be easy to direct the prow wherever you wish.
            Here is an example: suppose you wish to go from north-east to south-west, place the
            chart in 
            such manner that the ship should have her head to west and the poop to the east; then
            on the circle of the winds, divided into 360, or in four times 90, fix two pins, one at 45 
            degrees between east and north, the other at 45 degrees between west and south; bring
            the two pins on the line of the meridian by turning the ship's head for that purpose,
            and 
            the prow will be directed to the place to which you are going. If the pins do not
            come in a line with the meridian, it is a sign that you are navigating in a false
            direction, and
            you must rectify the course. When you reach land, you will see that what I have said
            is true.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"With an astrolabe made with plates, <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> observations may be taken of the meridian line, the poles, and the equinoctial line,
            at any hour of the day or night, looking at the moon
            or any star; and for these, place in the middle of the astrolabe instead of the verghezita or sight, <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup> two straight bars between which you will observe the star."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Thus the method being known by which the required direction is given to the ship,
            the author teaches the method for determining the point or degree on the chart of
            the winds, <sup><span class="ref"></span></sup>
            to which the ship on leaving a place to go to a given country should be directed.
            For clearness, he gives some examples of this. "Do you wish," he says, "to go from south to north,
            or vice versâ, on the same longitude? always proceed on the same meridian. Do you
            wish to go from east to west, or vice versâ, in the same latitude? always proceed
            on the same 
            parallel. Do you wish to go from one place to another as many degrees distant in longitude
            as it is different in latitude? Then take the course of 45 degrees either to the south-west
            
            or south-east, or north-west or north-east. If the latitude is greater than the longitude,
            then add to the 45 degrees as many degrees towards the nearest pole, as the number
            of 
            degrees by which the latitude exceeds the longitude. For instance, if I wish to go
            from Cape St. Vincent to Cape Bojador, I reckon the degrees of longitude and those of latitude 
            to know the difference between these two capes. I find that the degrees of longitude
            are five and a half, and those of latitude are eleven, from which I subtract the degrees
            of 
            longitude and there remain 5 deg. 30 min. Then, instead of going in the direction of from north-east to south-west (as I should
            do if the longitude were equal to the latitude], 
            I go from 5 deg. 30 min. above north-east towards north, to 5 deg. 30 min. below south-west
            towards south. If the longitude is greater than the latitude, the lesser number is
            still 
            subtracted from the greater: and the direction will be 45 deg. after deducting the
            residue. For instance, do you want to go from the island of Ferro to Guadeloupe; you know that the 
            first is in 27 deg. latitude and the second in 15 deg.; then take their difference, which is 12 deg.: look at the map for their longitude, and you see that Ferro is in 1 deg. and 
            Guadeloupe in 45 deg., whence their difference is 44 deg.: subtract from these the 12 deg. residue
            of latitude, and there remain 32 deg. Then you must subtract these 32 deg. from 
            45 deg., and there will remain 13 deg. Therefore your course will be from north-east 13 deg. north to south-west 13 deg. south.
         </p>
         
         "Direction of the Winds.
         
         
         <p>"The rose of the winds, divided into 360 deg., will give a clearer idea of what has
            been here said; it being well understood that the pilot must place the center of the
            winds on 
            the point from which he starts, or from which he takes the course, and he must fix
            the pole to the true pole observed from the sun, and not trusting to the compass,
            which north-easts 
            or north-wests.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"Then, to ascertain whence comes the wind, place a little stick with a little sail[18]
            in the centre of your rose or circle of winds, divided into 360 deg., and placed in

            manner that north and south stand on the true Solar meridian. The direction of the vane moved by the wind will indicate exactly which wind blows:
            on the equinoctial is east and west; 
            at 45 deg. there is north-east, south-west, north-west, and south-east; at 22½ deg.
            towards north you have north-north-east, and so on with the others."

               <span class="persName">Pigafetta</span> who have treated of the astrolabe, such as <span class="persName">Regiomontanus</span>, <span class="persName">Appianus</span>, <span class="persName">Gimma</span>, <span class="persName">Frisius</span>,

         <sup><span class="ref"><span class="persName">Amoretti</span>, in his introduction to this Treatise of Navigation, in the Milan edition, observes
               that <span class="persName">Pigafetta</span> was misled by a false theory when he supposes that there is in the 
               heavens a point in repose to which the magnetic needle tends, but that the exact direction
               of the magnetic needle coincided, or at least approximated to the meridian of the
               isle 
               of Ferro, which is not now the case; and that in some other places the variation of the compass
               had been observed to correspond with that of the longitude. By the table of 
               variations of the compass published by <span class="persName">Lambert</span> in the Ephemerides of Berlin (Astronomische Jahrbuch) for the year 1779, it is seen by an easy calculation that at the beginning 
               of the sixteenth century the magnetic equator or zero of deviation was very near the
               isle of Tenerife. Now it is further off, and the distance increases. M. de Bouganville
               found 
               there the deviation to the west to be 14 deg. 41 min.; and <span class="persName">Staunton</span>, the companion of Lord<span class="persName">Macartney</span>, found it to be 17 deg. 35 min.</span></sup>
