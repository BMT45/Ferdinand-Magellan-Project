                  Vicenza</span>, and <span class="rank">Knight of Rhodes</span>, to the very
               illustrious and very excellent <span class="rank">Lord</span>
               <span class="persName">Philip de Villiers Lisleaden</span>, the famous <span
                  class="rank">Grand Master of Rhodes</span>, his most respected Lord</p>
            <p>Since there are several curious persons (very illustrious and very reverend lord) who
               not only are pleased to listen to and learn the great and wonderful things which God
               has permitted me to see and suffer in the long and perilous navigation, which I have
               performed (and which is written hereafter), but also they desire to learn the methods
               and fashions of the road which I have taken in order to go thither, [and who do] not
               grant firm belief to the end unless they are first well advised and assured of the
               commencement. Therefore, my lord, it will please you to hear that finding myself in
                  <span class="placeName">Spain</span> in the year of the Nativity of our Lord, one
               thousand five hundred and nineteen, at the court of the most serene king of the
               Romans, with the reverend lord, <span class="persName">Mons</span>. <span
                  class="persName">Francis Cheregato</span>, then apostolic proto-notary, and
               ambassador of the <span class="persName">Pope Leon the Tenth</span>, who, through his
               virtue, afterwards arrived at the bishoprick of Aprutino and the principality of
               Theramo, and knowing both by the reading of many books and by the report of many
               lettered and well-informed persons who conversed with the said proto-notary, the very
               great and awful things of the ocean, I deliberated, with the favour of the Emperor
               and the above-named lord, to experiment and go and see with my eyes a part of those
               things. By which means I could satisfy the desire of the said lords, and mine own
               also. So that it might be said that I had performed the said voyage, and seen well
               with my eyes the things hereafter written.</p>
            <p>Now in order to decypher the commencement of my voyage (very illustrious lord);
               having heard that there was in the city of <span class="placeName">Seville</span>, a
               small armade to the number of five ships, ready to perform this long voyage, that is
               to say, to find the islands of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>, from whence the
               spices come: of which armade the captain-general was <span class="persName">Fernand
                  de Magaglianes</span>, a <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> gentleman,
               commander of St. James of the Sword, who had performed several voyages in the ocean
               sea (in which he had behaved very honourably as a good man), I set out with many
               others in my favour from Barcelona, where at the time the Emperor was, and came by
               sea as far as Malaga, and thence I went away by land until I arrived at the said city
               of <span class="placeName">Seville</span>. There I remained for the space of three
               months, waiting till the said armade was in order and readiness to perform its
               voyage. And because (very illustrious lord) that on the return from the said voyage,
               on going to Rome towards the holiness of our Holy Father, I found your lordship at
                  <span class="placeName">Monterosa</span>, where of your favour you gave me a good
               reception, and afterwards gave me to understand that you desired to have in writing
               the things which God of His grace had permitted me to see in my said voyage;
               therefore to satisfy and accede to your desire, I have reduced into this small book
               the principal things, in the best manner that I have been able.</p>
            <p>Finally (very illustrious lord), after all provisions had been made, and the vessels
               were in order, the captain-general, a discreet and virtuous man, careful of his
               honour, would not commence his voyage without first making some good and wholesome
               ordinances, such as it is the good custom to make for those who go to sea.
               Nevertheless he did not entirely declare the voyage which he was going to make, so
               that his men should not from amazement and fear be unwilling to accompany him on so
               long a voyage, as he had undertaken in his intention. Considering the great and
               impetuous storms which are on the ocean sea, where I wished to go; and for another
               reason also, that is to say that the masters and captains of the other ships of his
               company did not love him: of this I do not know the reason, except by cause of his,
               the captain-general, being <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, and they were
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Spaniards</span> or Castilians, who for a long time have
               been in rivalry and ill will with one another. Notwithstanding this all were obedient
               to him. He made his ordinances such as those which follow, so that during the storms
               at sea, which often come on by night and day, his ships should not go away and
               separate from one another. These ordinances he published and made over in writing to
               each master of the ships, and commanded them to be observed and inviolably kept,
               unless there were great and legitimate excuses, and appearance of not having been
               able to do otherwise.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the said captain-general willed that the vessel in which he himself was
               should go before the other vessels, and that the others should follow it; therefore
               he carried by night on the poop of his ship a torch or faggot of burning wood, which
               they called farol, which burned all the night, so that his ships should not lose
               sight of him. Sometimes he set a lantern, sometimes a thick cord of reeds was
               lighted, which was called trenche. This is made of reeds well soaked in the water,
               and much beaten, then they are dried in the sun or in the smoke, and it is a thing
               very suitable for such a matter. When the captain had made one of his signals to his
               people, they answered in the same way. In that manner they knew whether the ships
               were following and keeping together or not. And when he wished to take a tack on
               account of the change of weather, or if the wind was contrary, or if he wished to
               make less way, he had two lights shown; and if he wished the others to lower their
               small sail, which was a part of the sail attached to the great sail, he showed three
               lights. Also by the three lights, notwithstanding that the wind was fair for going
               faster, he signalled that the studding sail should be lowered; so that the great sail
               might be quicker and more easily struck and furled when bad weather should suddenly
               set in, on account of some squall or otherwise. Likewise when the captain wished the
               other ships to lower the sail he had four lights shown, which shortly after he had
               put out and then showed a single one, which was a signal that he wished to stop there
               and turn, so that the other ships might do as he did. Withal, when he discovered any
               land, or shoal, that is to say, a rock at sea, he made several lights be shown or had
               a bombard fired off. If he wished to make sail, he signalled to the other ships with
               four lights, so that they should do as he did, and follow him. He always carried this
               said lantern suspended to the poop of his vessel. Also when he wished the studding
               sail to be replaced with the great sail, he showed three lights. And to know whether
               all the ships followed him and were coming together, he showed one light only besides
               the fanol, and then each of the ships showed another light, which was an answering
               signal.</p>
            <p>Besides the above-mentioned ordinances for carrying on seamanship as is fitting, and
               to avoid the dangers which may come upon those who do not keep watch, the said
               captain, who was expert in the things required for navigation, ordered that three
               watches should be kept at night. The first was at the beginning of the night, the
               second at midnight, and the third towards break of day, which is commonly called La
               diane, otherwise the star of the break of day. Every night these watches were
               changed; that is to say, he who had kept the first watch, on the following day kept
               the second, and he who had kept the second kept the third; and so on they changed
               continually every night. The said captain commanded that his regulations both for the
               signals and the watches should be well observed, so that their voyage should be made
               with greater security. The crews of this fleet were divided into three companies; the
               first belonged to the captain, the second to the pilot or nochier, and the third to
               the master. These regulations having been made, the captain-general deliberated on
               sailing, as follows.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday, the day of St. Laurence, the 10th of August</span>, in the
               year above mentioned, the fleet, provided with what was necessary for it, and
               carrying crews of different nations, to the number of two hundred and thirty-seven
               men in all the five ships, was ready to set sail from the mole of <span
                  class="placeName">Seville</span>; and firing all the artillery, we made sail only
               on the foremast, and came to the end of a river named Betis, which is now called
               Guadalcavir. In going along this river we passed by a place named <span
                  class="placeName">Gioan de Farax</span>, where there was a large population of
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span>, and there was a bridge over the river by
               which one went to <span class="placeName">Seville</span>. This bridge was ruined,
               however there had remained two columns which are at the bottom of the water, on which
               account it is necessary to have people of the country of experience and knowledge to
               point out the convenient spot for safely passing between these two columns, from fear
               of striking against them. Besides that, it is necessary in order to pass safely by
               this bridge and by other places on this river, that the water should be rather high.
               After having passed the two columns we came to another place named <span
                  class="placeName">Coria</span>, and passing by many little villages lying along
               the said river, at last we arrived at a castle, which belongs to the Duke of Medina
               Sidonia, named <span class="persName">St. Lucar</span>, where there is a port from
               which to enter the ocean sea. It is entered by the east wind and you go out by the
               west wind. Near there is the <span class="placeName">cape of St. Vincent</span>,
               which, according to cosmography, is in thirty-seven degrees of latitude, at twenty
               miles distance from the said port; and from the aforesaid town to this port by the
               river there are thirty-five or forty miles. A few days afterwards the captain-general
               came along the said river with his boat, and the masters of the other ships with him,
               and we remained some days in this port to supply the fleet with some necessary
               things. We went every day to hear mass on shore, at a church named Our Lady of
               Barrameda, towards <span class="placeName">St. Lucar.</span> There the captain
               commanded that all the men of the fleet should confess before going on any further,
               in which he himself showed the way to the others. Besides he did not choose that
               anyone should bring any married woman, or others to the ships, for several good
               considerations.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Tuesday, the 20th September</span> of the said year, we set sail
               from <span class="placeName">St. Lucar</span>, making the course of the south-west
               otherwise named Labeiche; and on the twenty-sixth of the said month we arrived at an
               island of great Canaria, named Teneriphe, which is in twenty-eight degrees latitude;
               there we remained three days and a half to take in provisions and other things which
               were wanted. After that we set sail thence and came to a port named Monterose, where
               we sojourned two days to supply ourselves with pitch, which is a thing necessary for
               ships. It is to be known that among the other isles which are at the said great
               Canaria, there is one, where not a drop of water is to be found proceeding from a
               fountain or a river, only once a day at the hour of midday, there descends a cloud
               from the sky which envelops a large tree which is in this island, and it falls upon
               the leaves of the tree, and a great abundance of water distils from these leaves, so
               that at the foot of the tree there is so large a quantity of water that it seems as
               if there was an ever-running fountain. The men who inhabit this place are satisfied
               with this water; also the animals, both domestic and wild, drink of it.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday, the third of October of the said year</span>, at the hour
               of midnight, we set sail, making the course auster, which the levantine mariners call
                  <span class="placeName">Siroc</span>, entering into the ocean sea. We passed the
               Cape Verd and the neighbouring islands in fourteen-and-a-half degrees, and we
               navigated for several days by the coast of Guinea or Ethiopia; where there is a
               mountain called <span class="placeName">Sierra Leona</span>, which is in eight
               degrees latitude according to the art and science of cosmography and astrology.
               Sometimes we had the wind contrary and at other times sufficiently good, and rains
               without wind. In this manner we navigated with rain for the space of sixty days until
               the equinoctial line, which was a thing very strange and unaccustomed to be seen,
               according to the saying of some old men and those who had navigated here several
               times. Nevertheless, before reaching this equinoctial line we had in fourteen degrees
               a variety of weather and bad winds, as much on account of squalls as for the head
               winds and currents which came in such a manner that we could no longer advance. In
               order that our ships might not perish nor broach to (as it often happens when the
               squalls come together), we struck our sails, and in that manner we went about the sea
               hither and thither until the fair weather came. During the calm there came large
               fishes near the ships which they called Tiburoni (sharks), which have teeth of a
               terrible kind, and eat people when they find them in the sea either alive or dead.
               These fishes are caught with a device which the mariners call hamc, which is a hook
               of iron. Of these, some were caught by our men. However, they are worth nothing to
               eat when they are large; and even the small ones are worth but little. During these
               storms the body of St. Anselme appeared to us several times; amongst others, one
               night that it was very dark on account of the bad weather, the said saint appeared in
               the form of a fire lighted at the summit of the mainmast, and remained there near two
               hours and a half, which comforted us greatly, for we were in tears, only expecting
               the hour of perishing; and when that holy light was going away from us it gave out so
               great a brilliancy in the eyes of each, that we were near a quarter-of-an-hour like
               people blinded, and calling out for mercy. For without any doubt nobody hoped to
               escape from that storm. It is to be noted that all and as many times as that light
               which represents the said St. Anselme shows itself and descends upon a vessel which
               is in a storm at sea, that vessel never is lost. Immediately that this light had
               departed the sea grew calmer, and then we saw divers sorts of birds, amongst others
               there were some which had no fundament. There is also another kind of bird of such a
               nature that when the female wishes to lay her eggs she goes and lays them on the back
               of the male, and there it is that the eggs are hatched. This last kind have no feet
               and are always in the sea. There is another kind of bird which only lives on the
               droppings of the other birds, this is a true thing, and they are named Cagaselo, for
               I have seen them follow the other birds until they had done what nature ordered them
               to do; and after it has eat this dirty diet it does not follow any other bird until
               hunger returns to it; it always does the same thing. There are also fish which fly,
               and we saw a great quantity of them together, so many that it seemed that it was an
               island in the sea.</p>
            <p>After that we had passed the equinoctial line, towards the south, we lost the star of
               the tramontana, and we navigated between the south and Garbin, which is the
               collateral wind [or point] between south and west; and we crossed as far as a country
               named <span class="placeName">Verzin</span>, which is in twenty-four degrees and a
               half of the antarctic sky. This country is from <span class="placeName">the cape St.
                  Augustine</span>, which is in eight degrees in the antarctic sky. At this place we
               had refreshments of victuals, like fowls and meat of calves, also a variety of
               fruits, called battate, pigne (pine-apples), sweet, of singular goodness, and many
               other things, which I have omitted mentioning, not to be too long. The people of the
               said place gave, in order to have a knife, or a hook for catching fish, five or six
               fowls, and for a comb they gave two geese, and for a small mirror, or a pair of
               scissors, they gave so much fish that ten men could have eaten of it. And for a bell
               (or hawk's-bell) they gave a full basket of the fruit named battate; this has the
               taste of a chestnut, and is of the length of a shuttle. For a king of cards, of that
               kind which they used to play with in <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, they gave
               me five fowls, and thought they had cheated me. We entered into this port the day of
               Saint Lucy <span class="date">[13th December]</span>, before Christmas, on which day
               we had the sun on the zenith, which is a term of astrology. This zenith is a point in
               the sky, according to astrologers, and only in imagination, and it answers to over
               our head in a straight line, as may be seen by the treatise of the sphere, and by
               Aristotle, in the first book, De Cœlo et Mondo. On the day that we had the sun in the
               zenith we felt greater heat, as much as when we were on the equinoctial line.</p>
            <p>The said country of <span class="placeName">Verzin</span> is very abundant in all
               good things, and is larger than <span class="placeName">France</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>, and <span class="placeName">Italy</span> together.
               It is one of the countries which the King of Portugal has conquered [acquired]. Its
               inhabitants are not <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>, and adore nothing,
               but live according to the usage of nature, rather bestially than otherwise. Some of
               these people live a hundred, or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and forty years,
               and more; they go naked, both men and women. Their dwellings are houses that are
               rather long, and which they call "boy"; they sleep upon cotton nets, which they call,
               in their language, "amache." These nets are fastened to large timbers from one end of
               their house to the other. They make the fire to warm themselves right under their
               bed. It is to be known that in each of these houses, which they call "boy," there
               dwells a family of a hundred persons, who make a great noise. In this place they have
               boats, which are made of a tree, all in one piece, which they call "canoo." These are
               not made with iron instruments, for they have not got any, but with stones, like
               pebbles, and with these they plane and dig out these boats. Into these thirty or
               forty men enter, and their oars are made like iron shovels: and those who row these
               oars are black people, quite naked and shaven, and look like enemies of hell. The men
               and women of this said place are well made in their bodies. They eat the flesh of
               their enemies, not as good meat, but because they have adopted this custom. Now this
               custom arose as follows: an old woman of this place of <span class="placeName"
                  >Verzin</span> had an only son, who was killed by his enemies, and, some days
               afterwards, the friends of this woman captured one of the said enemies who had put
               her son to death, and brought him to where she was. Immediately the said old woman,
               seeing the man who was captured, and recollecting the death of her child, rushed upon
               him like a mad dog, and bit him on the shoulder. However, this man who had been taken
               prisoner found means to run away, and told how they had wished to eat him, showing
               the bite which the said old woman had made in his shoulder. After that those who were
               caught on one side or other were eaten. Through that arose this custom in this place
               of eating the enemies of each other. But they do not eat up the whole body of the man
               whom they take prisoner; they eat him bit by bit, and for fear that he should be
               spoiled, they cut him up into pieces, which they set to dry in the chimney, and every
               day they cut a small piece, and eat it with their ordinary victuals in memory of
               their enemies. I was assured that this custom was true by a pilot, named <span
                  class="persName">John Carvagio</span>, who was in our company, and had remained
               four years in this place; it is also to be observed that the inhabitants of this
               place, both men and women, are accustomed to paint themselves with fire, all over the
               body, and also the face. The men are shaven, and wear no beard, because they pluck it
               out themselves, and for all clothing they wear a circle surrounded with the largest
               feathers of parrots, and they only cover their posterior parts, which is a cause of
               laughter and mockery. The people of this place, almost all, excepting women and
               children, have three holes in the lower lip, and carry, hanging in them, small round
               stones, about a finger in length. These kind of people, both men and women, are not
               very black, but rather brown, and they openly show their shame, and have no hair on
               the whole of their bodies. The king of this country is called <span class="persName"
                  >Cacich</span>, and there are here an infinite number of parrots, of which they
               give eight or ten for a looking-glass; there are also some little cat-monkeys having
               almost the appearance of a lion; they are yellow, and handsome, and agreeable to look
               at. The people of this place make bread, which is of a round shape, and they take the
               marrow of certain trees which are there, between the bark and the tree, but it is not
               at all good, and resembles fresh cheese. There are also some pigs which have their
               navel on the back, and large birds which have their beak like a spoon, and they have
               no tongue. For a hatchet or for a knife they used to give us one or two of their
               daughters as slaves, but their wives they would not give up for anything in the
               world. According to what they say the women of this place never render duty to their
               husbands by day, but only at night; they attend to business out of doors, and carry
               all that they require for their husband's victuals inside small baskets on their
               heads; or fastened to their heads. Their husbands go with them, and carry a bow of
               vergin, or of black palm, with a handful of arrows of cane. They do this because they
               are very jealous of their wives. These carry their children fastened to their neck,
               and they are inside a thing made of cotton in the manner of a net. I omit relating
               many other strange things, not to be too prolix; however, I will not forget to say
               that mass was said twice on shore, where there were many people of the said country,
               who remained on their knees, and their hands joined in great reverence, during the
               mass, so that it was a pleasure and a subject of compassion to see them. In a short
               time they built a house for us, as they imagined that we should remain a long time
               with them, and, at our departure thence, they gave us a large quantity of verzin. It
               is a colour which proceeds from the trees which are in this country, and they are in
               such quantity that the country is called from it <span class="placeName"
                  >Verzin</span>.</p>
            <p>It is to be known that it happened that it had not rained for two months before we
               came there, and the day that we arrived it began to rain, on which account the people
               of the said place said that we came from heaven, and had brought the rain with us,
               which was great simplicity, and these people were easily converted to the Christian
               faith. Besides the above-mentioned things which were rather simple, the people of
               this country showed us another, very simple; for they imagined that the small ships'
               boats were the children of the ships, and that the said ships brought them forth when
               the boats were hoisted out to send the men hither and thither; and when the boats
               were alongside the ship they thought that the ships were giving them suck.</p>
            <p>A beautiful young girl came one day inside the ship of our captain, where I was, and
               did not come except to seek for her luck: however, she directed her looks to the
               cabin of the master, and saw a nail of a finger's length, *and went and took it as
               something valuable and new, and hid it in her hair, for otherwise she would not have
               been able to concealit, because she was naked,* and, bending forwards, she went away;
               and the captain and I saw this mystery.</p>
            <p>We remained thirteen days in this country of <span class="placeName">Verzin</span>,
               and, departing from it and following our course, we went as far as thirty-four
               degrees and a third towards the antarctic pole; there we found, near a river, men
               whom they call "cannibals," who eat human flesh, and one of these men, great as a
               giant, came to the captain's ship to ascertain and ask if the others might come. This
               man had a voice like a bull, and whilst this man was at the ship his companions
               carried off all their goods which they had to a castle further off, from fear of us.
               Seeing that, we landed a hundred men from the ships, and went after them to try and
               catch some others; however they gained in running away. This kind of people did more
               with one step than we could do at a bound. In this same river there were seven little
               islands, and in the largest of them precious stones are found. This place was
               formerly called the<span class="placeName"> Cape of St. Mary</span>, and it was
               thought there that from thence there was a passage to the <span class="placeName">Sea
                  of Sur</span>; that is to say, the<span class="placeName"> South Sea.</span> And
               it is not found that any ship has ever discovered anything more, having passed beyond
               the said cape. And now it is no longer a cape, but it is a river which has a mouth
               seventeen leagues in width, by which it enters into the sea. In past time, in this
               river, these great men named <span class="ethnicGroup">Canibali</span> ate a Spanish
               captain, named <span class="persName">John de Sola</span>, and sixty men who had gone
               to discover land, as we were doing, and trusted too much to them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards following the same course towards the <span class="placeName"
                  >Antarctic</span> pole, going along the land, we found two islands full of geese
               and goslings, and sea wolves, of which geese the large number could not be reckoned;
               for we loaded all the five ships with them in an hour. These geese are black, and
               have their feathers all over the body of the same size and shape, and they do not
               fly, and live upon fish; and they were so fat that they did not pluck them, but
               skinned them. They have beaks like that of a crow. The sea wolves of these two
               islands are of many colours, and of the size and thickness of a calf, and have a head
               like that of a calf, and the ears small and round. They have large teeth, and have no
               legs, but feet joining close on to the body, which resemble a human hand; they have
               small nails to their feet, and skin between the fingers like geese. If these animals
               could run they would be very bad and cruel, but they do not stir from the water, and
               swim and live upon fish. In this place we endured a great storm, and thought we
               should have been lost, but the three holy bodies, that is to say, St. Anselmo, St.
               Nicolas, and St.a. Clara, appeared to us, and immediately the storm ceased.</p>
            <p>Departing thence as far as forty nine degrees and a half in the <span
                  class="placeName">Antarctic</span> heavens (as we were in the winter), we entered
               into a port to pass the winter, and remained there two whole months without ever
               seeing anybody. However, one day, without anyone expecting it, we saw a giant, who
               was on the shore of the sea, quite naked, and was dancing and leaping, and singing,
               and whilst singing he put the sand and dust on his head. Our captain sent one of his
               men towards him, whom he charged to sing and leap like the other to reassure him, and
               show him friendship. This he did, and immediately the sailor led this giant to a
               little island where the captain was waiting for him; and when he was before us he
               began to be astonished, and to be afraid, and he raised one. finger on high, thinking
               that we came from heaven. He was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his
               waist; however he was well built. He had a large face, painted red all round, and his
               eyes also were painted yellow around them, and he had two hearts painted on his
               cheeks; he had but little hair on his head, and it was painted white. When he was
               brought before the captain he was clothed with the skin of a certain beast, which
               skin was very skilfully sewed. This beast has its head and ears of the size of a
               mule, and the neck and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a deer, and the
               tail like that of a horse, and it neighs like a horse. There is a great quantity of
               these animals in this same place. This giant had his feet covered with the skin of
               this animal in the form of shoes, and he carried in his hand a short and thick bow,
               with a thick cord made of the gut of the said beast, with a bundle of cane arrows,
               which were not very long, and were feathered like ours, but they had no iron at the
               end, though they had at the end some small white and black cut stones, and these
               arrows were like those which the Turks use. The captain caused food and drink to be
               given to this giant, then they showed him some things, amongst others, a steel
               mirror. When the giant saw his likeness in it, he was greatly terrified, leaping
               backwards, and made three or four of our men fall down. After that the captain gave
               him two bells, a mirror, a comb, and a chaplet of beads, and sent him back on shore,
               having him accompanied by four armed men. One of the companions of this giant, who
               would never come to the ship, on seeing the other coming back with our people, came
               forward and ran to where the other giants dwelled. These came one after the other all
               naked, and began to leap and sing, raising one finger to heaven, and showing to our
               people a certain white powder made of the roots of herbs, which they kept in earthen
               pots, and they made signs that they lived on that, and that they had nothing else to
               eat than this powder. Therefore our people made them signs to come to the ship and
               that they would help them to carry their bundles. Then these men came, who carried
               only their bows in their hands; but their wives came after them laden like donkeys,
               and carried their goods. These women are not as tall as the men, but they are very
               sufficiently large. When we saw them we were all amazed and astonished, for they had
               the breasts half an ell long, and had their faces painted, and were dressed like the
               men. But they wore a small skin before them to cover themselves. They brought with
               them four of those little beasts of which they make their clothing, and they led them
               with a cord in the manner of dogs coupled together. When these people wish to catch
               these animals with which they clothe themselves, they fasten one of the young ones to
               a bush, and afterwards the large ones come to play with the little one, and the
               giants are hid behind some hedge, and by shooting their arrows they kill the large
               ones. Our men brought eighteen of these giants, both men and women, whom they placed
               in two divisions, half on one side of the port, and the other half at the other, to
               hunt the said animals. Six days after, our people on going to cut wood, saw another
               giant, with his face painted and clothed like the abovementioned, he had in his hand
               a bow and arrows, and approaching our people he made some touches on his head and
               then on his body, and afterwards did the same to our people. And this being done he
               raised both his hands to heaven. When the captain-general knew all this, he sent to
               fetch him with his ship's boat, and brought him to one of the little islands which
               are in the port, where the ships were. In this island the captain had caused a house
               to be made for putting some of the ships' things in whilst he remained there. This
               giant was of a still better disposition than the others, and was a gracious and
               amiable person, who liked to dance and leap. When he leapt he caused the earth to
               sink in a palm depth at the place where his feet touched. He was a long time with us,
               and at the end we baptised him, and gave him the name of <span class="persName"
                  >John.</span> This giant pronounced the name of <span class="persName"
                  >Jesus</span>, the Pater noster, <span class="persName">Ave Maria</span>, and his
               name as clearly as we did: but he had a terribly strong and loud voice. The captain
               gave him a shirt and a tunic of cloth, and seaman's breeches, a cap, a comb, some
               bells, and other things, and sent him back to where he had come from. He went away
               very joyous and satisfied. The next day this giant returned, and brought one of those
               large animals before mentioned, for which the captain gave him some other things, so
               that he should bring more. But afterwards he did not return, and it is to be presumed
               that the other giants killed him because he had come to us.</p>
            <p>Fifteen days later we saw four other giants, who carried no arrows, for they had hid
               them in the bushes, as two of them showed us, for we took them all four, and each of
               them was painted in a different way. The captain retained the two younger ones to
               take them to <span class="placeName">Spain</span> on his return; but it was done by
               gentle and cunning means, for otherwise they would have done a hurt to some of our
               men. The manner in which he retained them was that he gave them many knives, forks,
               mirrors, bells, and glass, and they held all these things in their hands. Then the
               captain had some irons brought, such as are put on the feet of malefactors: these
               giants took pleasure in seeing the irons, but they did not know where to put them,
               and it grieved them that they could not take them with their hands, because they were
               hindered by the other things which they held in them. The other two giants were
               there, and were desirous of helping the other two, but the captain would not let
               them, and made a sign to the two whom he wished to detain that they would put those
               irons on their feet, and then they would go away: at this they made a sign with their
               heads that they were content. Immediately the captain had the irons put on the feet
               of both of them, and when they saw that they were striking with a hammer on the bolt
               which crosses the said irons to rivet them, and prevent them from being opened, these
               giants were afraid, but the captain made them a sign not to doubt of anything.
               Nevertheless when they saw the trick which had been played them, they began to be
               enraged, and to foam like bulls, crying out very loud Setebos, that is to say, the
               great devil, that he should help them. The hands of the other two giants were bound,
               but it was with great difficulty; then the captain sent them back on shore, with nine
               of his men to conduct them, and to bring the wife of one of those who had remained in
               irons, because he regretted her greatly, as we saw by signs. But in going away one of
               those two who were sent away, untied his hands and escaped, running with such
               lightness that our men lost sight of him, and he went away where his companions were
               staying; but he found nobody of those that he had left with the women because they
               had gone to hunt. However he went to look for them, and found them, and related to
               them all that had been done to them. The other giant whose hands were tied struggled
               as much as he could to unfasten himself, and to prevent his doing so, one of our men
               struck him, and hurt him on the head, at which he got very angry; however he led our
               people there where their wives were. Then <span class="persName">John Cavagio</span>,
               the pilot who was the chief conductor of these two giants, would not bring away the
               wife of one of the giants who had remained in irons on that evening, but was of
               opinion that they should sleep there, because it was almost night. During this time
               the one of the giants who had untied his hands came back from where he had been, with
               another giant, and they seeing their companion wounded on the head, said nothing at
               that moment, but next morning they spoke in their language to the women, and
               immediately all ran away together, and the smallest ran faster than the biggest, and
               they left all their chattels. Two of these giants being rather a long way off shot
               arrows at our men, and fighting thus, one of the giants pierced with an arrow the
               thigh of one of our men, of which he died immediately. Then seeing that he was dead,
               all ran away. Our men had cross-bows and guns, but they never could hit one of these
               giants, because they did not stand still in one place, but leaped hither and thither.
               After that, our men buried the man who had been killed, and set fire to the place
               where those giants had left their chattels. Certainly these giants run faster than a
               horse, and they are very jealous of their wives.</p>
            <p>When these giants have a stomach-ache, instead of taking medicine they put down their
               throats an arrow about two feet long; then they vomit a green bile mixed with blood:
               and the reason why they throw up this green matter is because they sometimes eat
               thistles. When they have headaches they make a cut across the forehead, and also on
               the arms and legs, to draw blood from several parts of their bodies. One of the two
               we had taken, and who was in our ship, said that the blood did not choose to remain
               in the place and spot of the body where pain was felt. These people have their hair
               cut short and clipped in the manner of monks with a tonsure: they wear a cord of
               cotton round their head, to this they hang their arrows when they go a-hunting.</p>
            <p>When one of them dies, ten or twelve devils appear and dance all round the dead man.
               It seems that these are painted, and one of these enemies is taller than the others,
               and makes a greater noise, and more mirth than the others: that is whence these
               people have taken the custom of painting their faces and bodies, as has been said.
               The greatest of these devils is called in their language Setebos, and the others
               Cheleule. Besides the above-mentioned things, this one who was in the ship with us,
               told us by signs that he had seen devils with two horns on their heads, and long hair
               down to their feet, and who threw out fire from their mouths and rumps. The captain
               named this kind of people Pataghom, who have no houses, but have huts made of the
               skins of the animals with which they clothe themselves, and go hither and thither
               with these huts of theirs, as the gypsies do; they live on raw meat, and eat a
               certain sweet root, which they call Capac. These two giants that we had in the ship
               ate a large basketful of biscuit, and rats without skinning them, and they drank half
               a bucket of water at each time.</p>
            <p>We remained in this port, which was called the port of <span class="placeName">St.
                  Julian</span>, about five months, during which there happened to us many strange
               things, of which I will tell a part. One was, that immediately that we entered into
               this port, the masters of the other four ships plotted treason against the
               captain-general, in order to put him to death. These were thus named: John of
               Carthagine, conductor of the fleet; the treasurer, Loys de Mendoza; the conductor,
               Anthony Cocha; and <span class="persName">Gaspar de Casada</span>. However, the
               treason was discovered, for which the treasurer was killed with stabs of a dagger,
               and then quartered. This <span class="persName">Gaspar de Casada</span> had his head
               cut off, and afterwards was cut into quarters; and the conductor having a few days
               later attempted another treason, was banished with a priest, and was put in that
               country called Pattagonia. The captain-general would not put this conductor to death,
               because the Emperor Charles had made him captain of one of the ships. One of our
               ships, named St. James, was lost in going to discover the coast; all the men,
               however, were saved by a miracle, for they were hardly wet at all. Two men of these,
               who were saved, came to us and told us all that had passed and happened, on which the
               captain at once sent some men with sacks full of biscuit for two months. So, each day
               we found something of the ship of the other men who had escaped from the ship which
               was lost; and the place where these men were was twenty-five leagues from us, and the
               road bad and full of thorns, and it required four days to go there, and no water to
               drink was to be found on the road, but only ice, and of that little. In this port of
               St. Julian there were a great quantity of long capres, called Missiglione; these had
               pearls in the midst. In this place they found incense, and ostriches, foxes,
               sparrows, and rabbits a good deal smaller than ours. We set up at the top of the
               highest mountain which was there a very large cross, as a sign that this country
               belonged to the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>; and we gave to this
               mountain the name of Mount of Christ.</p>
            <p>Departing thence, we found in fifty-one degrees less one-third (50°40' S. ), in the
                  <span class="placeName">Antarctic</span>, a river of fresh water, which was near
               causing us to be lost, from the great winds which it sent out; but God, of his
               favour, aided us. We were about two months in this river, as it supplied fresh water
               and a kind of fish an ell long, and very scaly, which is good to eat. Before going
               away, the captain chose that all should confess and receive the body of our Lord like
               good <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>.</p>
            <p>We remained thirteen days in this country of <span class="placeName">Verzin</span>,
               and, departing from it and following our course, we went as far as thirty-four
               degrees and a third towards the antarctic pole; there we found, near a river, men
               whom they call "cannibals," who eat human flesh, and one of these men, great as a
               giant, came to the captain's ship to ascertain and ask if the others might come. This
               man had a voice like a bull, and whilst this man was at the ship his companions
               carried off all their goods which they had to a castle further off, from fear of us.
               Seeing that, we landed a hundred men from the ships, and went after them to try and
               catch some others; however they gained in running away. This kind of people did more
               with one step than we could do at a bound. In this same river there were seven little
               islands, and in the largest of them precious stones are found. This place was
               formerly called the Cape of St. Mary, and it was thought there that from thence there
               was a passage to the Sea of Sur; that is to say, the South Sea. And it is not found
               that any ship has ever discovered anything more, having passed beyond the said cape.
               And now it is no longer a cape, but it is a river which has a mouth seventeen leagues
               in width, by which it enters into the sea. In past time, in this river, these great
               men named Canibali ate a Spanish captain, named John de Sola, and sixty men who had
               gone to discover land, as we were doing, and trusted too much to them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards following the same course towards the <span class="placeName"
                  >Antarctic</span> pole, going along the land, we found two islands full of geese
               and goslings, and sea wolves, of which geese the large number could not be reckoned;
               for we loaded all the five ships with them in an hour. These geese are black, and
               have their feathers all over the body of the same size and shape, and they do not
               fly, and live upon fish; and they were so fat that they did not pluck them, but
               skinned them. They have beaks like that of a crow. The sea wolves of these two
               islands are of many colours, and of the size and thickness of a calf, and have a head
               like that of a calf, and the ears small and round. They have large teeth, and have no
               legs, but feet joining close on to the body, which resemble a human hand; they have
               small nails to their feet, and skin between the fingers like geese. If these animals
               could run they would be very bad and cruel, but they do not stir from the water, and
               swim and live upon fish. In this place we endured a great storm, and thought we
               should have been lost, but the three holy bodies, that is to say, St. Anselmo, St.
               Nicolas, and St.a. Clara, appeared to us, and immediately the storm ceased.</p>
            <p>Departing thence as far as forty nine degrees and a half in the <span
                  class="placeName">Antarctic</span> heavens (as we were in the winter), we entered
               into a port to pass the winter, and remained there two whole months without ever
               seeing anybody. However, one day, without anyone expecting it, we saw a giant, who
               was on the shore of the sea, quite naked, and was dancing and leaping, and singing,
               and whilst singing he put the sand and dust on his head. Our captain sent one of his
               men towards him, whom he charged to sing and leap like the other to reassure him, and
               show him friendship. This he did, and immediately the sailor led this giant to a
               little island where the captain was waiting for him; and when he was before us he
               began to be astonished, and to be afraid, and he raised one. finger on high, thinking
               that we came from heaven. He was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his
               waist; however he was well built. He had a large face, painted red all round, and his
               eyes also were painted yellow around them, and he had two hearts painted on his
               cheeks; he had but little hair on his head, and it was painted white. When he was
               brought before the captain he was clothed with the skin of a certain beast, which
               skin was very skilfully sewed. This beast has its head and ears of the size of a
               mule, and the neck and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a deer, and the
               tail like that of a horse, and it neighs like a horse. There is a great quantity of
               these animals in this same place. This giant had his feet covered with the skin of
               this animal in the form of shoes, and he carried in his hand a short and thick bow,
               with a thick cord made of the gut of the said beast, with a bundle of cane arrows,
               which were not very long, and were feathered like ours, but they had no iron at the
               end, though they had at the end some small white and black cut stones, and these
               arrows were like those which the Turks use. The captain caused food and drink to be
               given to this giant, then they showed him some things, amongst others, a steel
               mirror. When the giant saw his likeness in it, he was greatly terrified, leaping
               backwards, and made three or four of our men fall down. After that the captain gave
               him two bells, a mirror, a comb, and a chaplet of beads, and sent him back on shore,
               having him accompanied by four armed men. One of the companions of this giant, who
               would never come to the ship, on seeing the other coming back with our people, came
               forward and ran to where the other giants dwelled. These came one after the other all
               naked, and began to leap and sing, raising one finger to heaven, and showing to our
               people a certain white powder made of the roots of herbs, which they kept in earthen
               pots, and they made signs that they lived on that, and that they had nothing else to
               eat than this powder. Therefore our people made them signs to come to the ship and
               that they would help them to carry their bundles. Then these men came, who carried
               only their bows in their hands; but their wives came after them laden like donkeys,
               and carried their goods. These women are not as tall as the men, but they are very
               sufficiently large. When we saw them we were all amazed and astonished, for they had
               the breasts half an ell long, and had their faces painted, and were dressed like the
               men. But they wore a small skin before them to cover themselves. They brought with
               them four of those little beasts of which they make their clothing, and they led them
               with a cord in the manner of dogs coupled together. When these people wish to catch
               these animals with which they clothe themselves, they fasten one of the young ones to
               a bush, and afterwards the large ones come to play with the little one, and the
               giants are hid behind some hedge, and by shooting their arrows they kill the large
               ones. Our men brought eighteen of these giants, both men and women, whom they placed
               in two divisions, half on one side of the port, and the other half at the other, to
               hunt the said animals. Six days after, our people on going to cut wood, saw another
               giant, with his face painted and clothed like the abovementioned, he had in his hand
               a bow and arrows, and approaching our people he made some touches on his head and
               then on his body, and afterwards did the same to our people. And this being done he
               raised both his hands to heaven. When the captain-general knew all this, he sent to
               fetch him with his ship's boat, and brought him to one of the little islands which
               are in the port, where the ships were. In this island the captain had caused a house
               to be made for putting some of the ships' things in whilst he remained there. This
               giant was of a still better disposition than the others, and was a gracious and
               amiable person, who liked to dance and leap. When he leapt he caused the earth to
               sink in a palm depth at the place where his feet touched. He was a long time with us,
               and at the end we baptised him, and gave him the name of John. This giant pronounced
               the name of Jesus, the Pater noster, Ave Maria, and his name as clearly as we did:
               but he had a terribly strong and loud voice. The captain gave him a shirt and a tunic
               of cloth, and seaman's breeches, a cap, a comb, some bells, and other things, and
               sent him back to where he had come from. He went away very joyous and satisfied. The
               next day this giant returned, and brought one of those large animals before
               mentioned, for which the captain gave him some other things, so that he should bring
               more. But afterwards he did not return, and it is to be presumed that the other
               giants killed him because he had come to us.</p>
            <p>Fifteen days later we saw four other giants, who carried no arrows, for they had hid
               them in the bushes, as two of them showed us, for we took them all four, and each of
               them was painted in a different way. The captain retained the two younger ones to
               take them to <span class="placeName">Spain</span> on his return; but it was done by
               gentle and cunning means, for otherwise they would have done a hurt to some of our
               men. The manner in which he retained them was that he gave them many knives, forks,
               mirrors, bells, and glass, and they held all these things in their hands. Then the
               captain had some irons brought, such as are put on the feet of malefactors: these
               giants took pleasure in seeing the irons, but they did not know where to put them,
               and it grieved them that they could not take them with their hands, because they were
               hindered by the other things which they held in them. The other two giants were
               there, and were desirous of helping the other two, but the captain would not let
               them, and made a sign to the two whom he wished to detain that they would put those
               irons on their feet, and then they would go away: at this they made a sign with their
               heads that they were content. Immediately the captain had the irons put on the feet
               of both of them, and when they saw that they were striking with a hammer on the bolt
               which crosses the said irons to rivet them, and prevent them from being opened, these
               giants were afraid, but the captain made them a sign not to doubt of anything.
               Nevertheless when they saw the trick which had been played them, they began to be
               enraged, and to foam like bulls, crying out very loud Setebos, that is to say, the
               great devil, that he should help them. The hands of the other two giants were bound,
               but it was with great difficulty; then the captain sent them back on shore, with nine
               of his men to conduct them, and to bring the wife of one of those who had remained in
               irons, because he regretted her greatly, as we saw by signs. But in going away one of
               those two who were sent away, untied his hands and escaped, running with such
               lightness that our men lost sight of him, and he went away where his companions were
               staying; but he found nobody of those that he had left with the women because they
               had gone to hunt. However he went to look for them, and found them, and related to
               them all that had been done to them. The other giant whose hands were tied struggled
               as much as he could to unfasten himself, and to prevent his doing so, one of our men
               struck him, and hurt him on the head, at which he got very angry; however he led our
               people there where their wives were. Then <span class="persName">John Cavagio</span>,
               the pilot who was the chief conductor of these two giants, would not bring away the
               wife of one of the giants who had remained in irons on that evening, but was of
               opinion that they should sleep there, because it was almost night. During this time
               the one of the giants who had untied his hands came back from where he had been, with
               another giant, and they seeing their companion wounded on the head, said nothing at
               that moment, but next morning they spoke in their language to the women, and
               immediately all ran away together, and the smallest ran faster than the biggest, and
               they left all their chattels. Two of these giants being rather a long way off shot
               arrows at our men, and fighting thus, one of the giants pierced with an arrow the
               thigh of one of our men, of which he died immediately. Then seeing that he was dead,
               all ran away. Our men had cross-bows and guns, but they never could hit one of these
               giants, because they did not stand still in one place, but leaped hither and thither.
               After that, our men buried the man who had been killed, and set fire to the place
               where those giants had left their chattels. Certainly these giants run faster than a
               horse, and they are very jealous of their wives.</p>
            <p>When these giants have a stomach-ache, instead of taking medicine they put down their
               throats an arrow about two feet long; then they vomit a green bile mixed with blood:
               and the reason why they throw up this green matter is because they sometimes eat
               thistles. When they have headaches they make a cut across the forehead, and also on
               the arms and legs, to draw blood from several parts of their bodies. One of the two
               we had taken, and who was in our ship, said that the blood did not choose to remain
               in the place and spot of the body where pain was felt. These people have their hair
               cut short and clipped in the manner of monks with a tonsure: they wear a cord of
               cotton round their head, to this they hang their arrows when they go a-hunting. </p>
            <p>When one of them dies, ten or twelve devils appear and dance all round the dead man.
               It seems that these are painted, and one of these enemies is taller than the others,
               and makes a greater noise, and more mirth than the others: that is whence these
               people have taken the custom of painting their faces and bodies, as has been said.
               The greatest of these devils is called in their language Setebos, and the others
               Cheleule. Besides the above-mentioned things, this one who was in the ship with us,
               told us by signs that he had seen devils with two horns on their heads, and long hair
               down to their feet, and who threw out fire from their mouths and rumps. The captain
               named this kind of people Pataghom, who have no houses, but have huts made of the
               skins of the animals with which they clothe themselves, and go hither and thither
               with these huts of theirs, as the gypsies do; they live on raw meat, and eat a
               certain sweet root, which they call Capac. These two giants that we had in the ship
               ate a large basketful of biscuit, and rats without skinning them, and they drank half
               a bucket of water at each time.</p>
            <p>We remained in this port, which was called the port of St. Julian, about five months,
               during which there happened to us many strange things, of which I will tell a part.
               One was, that immediately that we entered into this port, the masters of the other
               four ships plotted treason against the captain-general, in order to put him to death.
               These were thus named: John of Carthagine, conductor of the fleet; the treasurer,
               Loys de Mendoza; the conductor, Anthony Cocha; and <span class="persName">Gaspar de
                  Casada</span>. However, the treason was discovered, for which the treasurer was
               killed with stabs of a dagger, and then quartered. This <span class="persName">Gaspar
                  de Casada</span> had his head cut off, and afterwards was cut into quarters; and
               the conductor having a few days later attempted another treason, was banished with a
               priest, and was put in that country called Pattagonia. The captain-general would not
               put this conductor to death, because the Emperor Charles had made him captain of one
               of the ships. One of our ships, named St. James, was lost in going to discover the
               coast; all the men, however, were saved by a miracle, for they were hardly wet at
               all. Two men of these, who were saved, came to us and told us all that had passed and
               happened, on which the captain at once sent some men with sacks full of biscuit for
               two months. So, each day we found something of the ship of the other men who had
               escaped from the ship which was lost; and the place where these men were was
               twenty-five leagues from us, and the road bad and full of thorns, and it required
               four days to go there, and no water to drink was to be found on the road, but only
               ice, and of that little. In this port of <span class="placeName">St. Julian</span>
               there were a great quantity of long capres, called Missiglione; these had pearls in
               the midst. In this place they found incense, and ostriches, foxes, sparrows, and
               rabbits a good deal smaller than ours. We set up at the top of the highest mountain
               which was there a very large cross, as a sign that this country belonged to the King
               of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>; and we gave to this mountain the name of
               Mount of Christ.</p>
            <p>Departing thence, we found in fifty-one degrees less one-third (50°40' S.), in the
                  <span class="placeName">Antarctic</span>, a river of fresh water, which was near
               causing us to be lost, from the great winds which it sent out; but God, of his
               favour, aided us. We were about two months in this river, as it supplied fresh water
               and a kind of fish an ell long, and very scaly, which is good to eat. Before going
               away, the captain chose that all should confess and receive the body of our Lord like
               good <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>.</p>
            <p>CHAPTER</p>. <p>After going and taking the course to the fifty-second degree of the
               said <span class="placeName">Antarctic</span> sky, <span class="date">on the day of
                  the Eleven Thousand Virgins [October 21]</span>, we found, by a miracle, a strait
               which we called the Cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, this strait is a hundred and
               ten leagues long, which are four hundred and forty miles, and almost as wide as less
               than half a league, and it issues in another sea, which is called the peaceful sea;
               it is surrounded by very great and high mountains covered with snow. In this place it
               was not possible to anchor with the anchors, because no bottom was found, on which
               account they were forced to put the moorings of twenty-five or thirty fathoms length
               on shore. This strait was a round place surrounded by mountains, as I have said, and
               the greater number of the sailors thought that there was no place by which to go out
               thence to enter into the peaceful sea. But the captain-general said that there was
               another strait for going out, and said that he knew it well, because he had seen it
               by a marine chart of the King of Portugal, which map had been made by a great pilot
               and mariner named Martin of Bohemia. The captain sent on before two of his ships, one
               named St. Anthony and the other the Conception, to seek for and discover the outlet
               of this strait, which was called the Cape de la Baya. And we, with the other two
               ships, that is to say, the flagship named Trinitate, and the other the Victory,
               remained waiting for them within the Bay, where in the night we had a great storm,
               which lasted till the next day at midday, and during which we were forced to weigh
               the anchors and let the ships go hither and thither about the bay. The other two
               ships met with such a head wind that they could not weather a cape which the bay made
               almost at its extremity; wishing to come to us, they were near being driven to beach
               the ships. But, on approaching the extremity of the bay, and whilst expecting to be
               lost, they saw a small mouth, which did not resemble a mouth but a corner, and (like
               people giving up hope) they threw themselves into it, so that by force they
               discovered the strait. Seeing that it was not a corner, but a strait of land, they
               went further on and found a bay, then going still further they found another strait
               and another bay larger than the first two, at which, being very joyous, they suddenly
               returned backwards to tell it to the captain-general. Amongst us we thought that they
               had perished: first, because of the great storm; next, because two days had passed
               that we had not seen them. And being thus in doubt we saw the two ships under all
               sail, with ensigns spread, come towards us: these, when near us, suddenly discharged
               much artillery, at which we, very joyous, saluted them with artillery and shouts.
               Afterwards, all together, thanking God and the <span class="persName">Virgin
                  Mary</span>, we went to seek further on.</p>
            <p>After having entered inside this strait we found that there were two mouths, of which
               one trended to the Sirocco (S.E.), and the other to the Garbin (S.W.). On that
               account the captain again sent the two ships, St. Anthony and Conception, to see if
               the mouth which was towards Sirocco had an outlet beyond into the said peaceful sea.
               One of these two ships, named St. Anthony, would not wait for the other ship, because
               those who were inside wished to return to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>: this
               they did, and the principal reason was on account of the pilot of the said ship being
               previously discontented with the said captain-general, because that before this
               armament was made, this pilot had gone to the Emperor to talk about having some ships
               to discover countries. But, on account of the arrival of the captain-general, the
               Emperor did not give them to this pilot, on account of which he agreed with some
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Spaniards</span>, and the following night they took
               prisoner the captain of their ship, who was a brother of the captain-general, and who
               was named Alvar de Meschite; they wounded him, and put him in irons. So they carried
               him off to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. And in this ship, which went away
               and returned, was one of the two above-mentioned giants whom we had taken, and when
               he felt the heat he died. The other ship, named the Conception, not being able to
               follow that one, was always waiting for it, and fluttered hither and thither. But it
               lost its time, for the other took the road by night for returning. When this
               happened, at night the ship of the captain and the other ship went together to
               discover the other mouth to Garbin (S.W.), where, on always holding on our course, we
               found the same strait. But at the end we arrived at a river which we named the River
               of Sardines, because we found a great quantity of them. So we remained there four
               days to wait for the other two ships. A short time after we sent a boat well supplied
               with men and provisions to discover the cape of the other sea: these remained three
               days in going and coming. They told us that they had found the cape, and the sea
               great and wide. At the joy which the captain-general had at this he began to cry, and
               he gave the name of Cape of Desire to this cape, as a thing which had been much
               desired for a long time. Having done that we turned back to find the two ships which
               were at the other side, but we only found the Conception, of which ship we asked what
               had become of her companion. To this the captain of the said ship, named <span
                  class="persName">John Serrano</span> (who was pilot of the first ship which was
               lost as has been related), replied that he knew nothing of her, and that he had never
               seen her since she entered the mouth. However, we sought for her through all the
               strait, as far as the said mouth, by which she had taken her course to return.
               Besides that, the captain-general sent back the ship named the Victory as far as the
               entrance of the strait to see if the ship was there, and he told the people of this
               ship that if they did not find the ship they were looking for, they were to place an
               ensign on the summit of a small hill, with a letter inside a pot placed in the ground
               near the ensign, so that if the ship should by chance return, it might see that
               ensign, and also find the letter which would give information of the course which the
               captain was holding. This manner of acting had been ordained by the captain from the
               commencement, in order to effect the junction of any ship which might be separated
               from the others. So the people of the said ship did what the captain had commanded
               them, and more, for they set two ensigns with letters; one of the ensigns was placed
               on a small hill at the first bay, the other on an islet in the third bay, where there
               were many sea wolves and large birds. The captain-general waited for them with the
               other ship near the river named Isles: and he caused a cross to be set upon a small
               island in front of that river, which was between high mountains covered with snow.
               This river comes and falls into the sea near the other river of the Sardines.</p>
            <p>If we had not found this strait the captain-general had made up his mind to go as far
               as seventy-five degrees towards the antarctic pole; where at that height in the
               summer time there is no night, or very little: in a similar manner in the winter
               there is no day-light, or very little, and so that every one may believe this, when
               we were in this strait the night lasted only three hours, and this was in the month
               of October.</p>
            <p>The land of this strait on the left hand side looked towards the Sirocco wind, which
               is the wind collateral to the Levant and South; we called this strait Pathagonico. In
               it we found at every half league a good port and place for anchoring, good waters,
               wood all of cedar, and fish like sardines, missiglioni, and a very sweet herb named
               appio (celery). There is also some of the same kind which is bitter. This herb grows
               near the springs, and from not finding anything else we ate of it for several days. I
               think that there is not in the world a more beautiful country, or better strait than
               this one. In this ocean sea one sees a very amusing chase of fish, which are of three
               sorts, of an ell or more in length, and they call these fish Dorades, Albacores, and
               Bonitos; these follow and pursue another sort of fish which flies, which they call
               Colondriny, which are a foot long or more, and are very good to eat. When these three
               sorts of fish find in the water any of these flying fish, immediately they make them
               come out of the water, and they fly more than a cross bow-shot, as long as their
               wings are wet; and whilst these fishes fly the other three run after them under the
               water, seeing the shadow of those that fly: and the moment they fall into the water
               they are seized upon and eaten by the others which pursue them, which is a thing
               marvellous and agreeable to see. the sun, rain, and wind, and we left them for four
               or five days in the sea, and then we put them a little on the embers, and so ate
               them; also the sawdust of wood, and rats which cost half-a-crown each, moreover
               enough of them were not to be got. Besides the above-named evils, this misfortune
               which I will mention was the worst, it was that the upper and lower gums of most of
               our men grew so much that they could not eat, and in this way so many suffered, that
               nineteen died, and the other giant, and an Indian from the county of <span
                  class="placeName">Verzin</span>. Besides those who died, twenty-five or thirty
               fell ill of diverse sicknesses, both in the arms and legs, and other places, in such
               manner that very few remained healthy. However, thanks be to the Lord, I had no
               sickness. During those three months and twenty days we went in an open sea, while we
               ran fully four thousand leagues in the Pacific sea. This was well named Pacific, for
               during this same time we met with no storm, and saw no land except two small
               uninhabited islands, in which we found only birds and trees. We named them the
               Unfortunate Islands; they are two hundred leagues apart from one another, and there
               is no place to anchor, as there is no bottom. There we saw many sharks, which are a
               kind of large fish which they call Tiburoni. The first isle is in fifteen degrees of
               austral latitude, and the other island is in nine degrees. With the said wind we ran
               each day fifty or sixty leagues, or more; now with the wind astern, sometimes on a
               wind or otherwise. And if our Lord and his Mother had not aided us in giving us good
               weather to refresh ourselves with provisions and other things, we should all have
               died of hunger in this very vast sea, and I think that never man will undertake to
               perform such a voyage.</p>
            <p>When we had gone out of this strait, if we had always navigated to the west we should
               have gone without finding any land except the <span class="placeName">Cape of the
                  Eleven Thousand Virgins</span>, which is the eastern head of the strait in the
               ocean sea, with the <span class="placeName">Cape of Desire</span> at the west in the
               Pacific sea. These two capes are exactly in fifty-two degrees of latitude of the
               antarctic pole. </p>
            <p>The antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic, for there are to be
               seen there many small stars congregated together, which are like to two clouds a
               little separated from one another, and a little dimmed, in the midst of which are two
               stars, not very large, nor very brilliant, and they move but little: these two stars
               are the antarctic pole. Our compass needle still pointed a little to its arctic pole;
               nevertheless it had not as much power as on its own side and region. Yet when we were
               in the open sea, the captain-general asked of all the pilots, whilst still going
               under sail, in what direction they were navigating and pointing the charts. They all
               replied, by the course he had given, punctually [pricked in]; then he answered, that
               they were pointing falsely (which was so), and that it was fitting to arrange the
               needle of navigation, because it did not receive so much force as in its own quarter.
               When we were in the middle of this open sea we saw a cross of five stars, very
               bright, straight, in the west, and they are straight one with another. </p>
            <p>During this time of two months and twelve days we navigated between west and
               north-west (maestral), and a quarter west of north-west, and also north-west, until
               we came to the equinoctial line, which was at [a point] one hundred and twenty-two
               degrees distant from the line of repartition. This line of delimitation is thirty
               degrees distant from the meridian, and the meridian is three degrees distant from the
               Cape Verd towards the east. In going by this course we passed near two very rich
               islands; one is in twenty degrees latitude in the antarctic pole, and is called <span
                  class="placeName">Cipanghu</span>; the other, in fifteen degrees of the same pole,
               is named Sumbdit Pradit. After we had passed the equinoctial line we navigated
               between west, and north-west and a quarter west, by north-west. Afterwards we made
               two hundred leagues to westwards, then changed the course to a quarter of south-west,
               until in thirteen degrees north latitude, in order to approach the land of Cape
               Gaticara, which cape (under correction of those who have made cosmography), (for they
               have never seen it), is not placed where they think, but is towards the north, in
               twelve degrees or thereabouts. </p>
            <p>After having navigated sixty leagues by the said course, in twelve degrees latitude,
               and a hundred and forty-six of longitude, on Wednesday, the 6th of March, we
               discovered a small island in the north-west direction,and two others lying to the
               south-west. One of these islands was larger and higher than the other two. The
               captain-general wished to touch at the largest of these three islands to get
               refreshments of provisions; but it was not possible because the people of these
               islands entered into the ships and robbed us, in such a way that it was impossible to
               preserve oneself from them. Whilst we were striking and lowering the sails to go
               ashore, they stole away with much address and diligence the small boat called the
               skiff, which was made fast to the poop of the captain's ship, at which he was much
               irritated, and went on shore with forty armed men, burned forty or fifty houses, with
               several small boats, and killed seven men of the island; they recovered their skiff.
               After this we set sail suddenly, following the same course. Before we went ashore
               some of our sick men begged us that if we killed man or woman, that we should bring
               them their entrails, as they would see themselves suddenly cured. </p>
            <p>CHAPTER</p>
            <p>It must be known that when we wounded any of this kind of people with our arrows,
               which entered inside their bodies, they looked at the arrow, and then drew it forth
               with much astonishment, and immediately afterwards they died. Immediately after we
               sailed from that island, following our course, and those people seeing that we were
               going away followed us for n league, with a hundred small boats, or more, and they
               approached our ships, showing to us fish, and feigning to give it to us. But they
               threw stones at us, and then ran away, and in their flight they passed with their
               little boats between the boat which is towed at the poop and the ship going under
               full sail; but they did this so quickly, and with such skill that it was a wonder.
               And we saw some of these women, who cried out and tore their hair, and I believe that
               it was for the love of those whom we had killed. </p>
            <p>CHAPTER</p>
            <p>These people live in liberty and according to their will, for they have no lord or
               superior; they go quite naked, and some of them wear beards, and have their hair down
               to the waist. They wear small hats, after the fashion of the Albanians; these hats
               are made of palm leaves. The people are as tall as us, and well made: they adore
               nothing, and when they are born they are white, later they become brown, and have
               their teeth black and red. The women also go naked, except that they cover their
               nature with a thin bark, pliable like paper, which grows between the tree and the
               bark of the palm. They are beautiful and delicate, and whiter than the men, and have
               their hair loose and flowing, very black and long, down to the earth. They do not go
               to work in the fields, nor stir from their houses, making cloth and baskets of palm
               leaves. Their provisions are certain fruits named Cochi, Battate; there are birds,
               figs a palm long, sweet canes, and flying fish. The women anoint their bodies and
               their hair with oil of cocho and giongioli (sesame). Their houses are constructed of
               wood, covered with planks, with fig leaves, which are two ells in length: they have
               only one floor: their rooms and beds are furnished with mats, which we call matting,
               which are made of palm leaves, and are very beautiful, and they lie down on palm
               straw, which is soft and fine. These people have no arms, but use sticks, which have
               a fish bone at the end. They are poor, but ingenious, and great thieves, and for the
               sake of that we called these three islands the Ladrone Islands. The pastime of the
               men and the women of this place, and their diversion, is to go with their little
               boats to catch those fish which fly, with hooks made of fish bones. The pattern of
               their small boats is painted here-after, they are like the fuseleres,but narrower.
               Some of them black and white, and others red. On the opposite side to the sail, they
               have a large piece of wood, pointed above, with poles across, which are in the water,
               in order to go more securely under sail: their sails are of palm leaves, sewed
               together, and of the shape of a lateen sail, fore and aft. They have certain shovels
               like hearth shovels, and there is no difference between the poop and the prow in
               these boats, and they are like dolphins bounding from wave to wave. These thieves
               thought, according to the signs they made, that there were no other men in the world
               besides them. </p>
            <p><span class="date">Saturday, the 16th of March, 1521</span>, we arrived at daybreak
               in sight of a high island, three hundred leagues distant from the before-mentioned
               Thieves' island. This isle is named <span class="placeName">Zamal</span>. The next
               day the captain-general wished to land at another uninhabited island near the first,
               to be in greater security and to take water, also to repose there a few days. He set
               up there two tents on shore for the sick, and had a sow killed for them.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday, the 18th of March</span>, after dinner, we saw a boat come
               towards us with nine men in it: upon which the captain-general ordered that no one
               should move or speak without his permission. When these people had come into this
               island towards us, immediately the principal one amongst them went towards the
               captain-general with demonstrations of being very joyous at our arrival. Five of the
               most showy of them remained with us, the others who remained with the boat went to
               call some men who were fishing, and afterwards all of them came together. The captain
               seeing that these people were reasonable, ordered food and drink to be given them,
               and he gave them some red caps, looking glasses, combs, bells, ivory, and other
               things. When these people saw the politeness of the captain, they presented some
               fish, and a vessel of palm wine, which they call in their language Uraca; figs more
               than a foot long, and others smaller and of a better savour, and two cochos. At that
               time they had nothing to give him, and they made signs to us with their hands that in
               four days they would bring us Umai, which is rice, cocos, and many other
               victuals.</p>
            <p>To explain the kind of fruits above-named it must be known that the one which they
               call cochi, is the fruit which the palm trees bear. And as we have bread, wine, oil,
               and vinegar, proceeding from different kinds, so these people have those things
               proceeding from these palm trees only. It must be said that wine proceeds from the
               said palm trees in the following manner. They make a hole at the summit of the tree
               as far as its heart, which is named palmito, from which a liquor comes out in drops
               down the tree, like white must, which is sweet, but with somewhat of bitter. They
               have canes as thick as the leg, in which they draw off this liquor, and they fasten
               them to the tree from the evening till next morning, and from the morning to the
               evening, because this liquor comes little by little. This palm produces a fruit named
               cocho, which is as large as the head, or thereabouts: its first husk is green, and
               two fingers in thickness, in it they find certain threads, with which they make the
               cords for fastening their boats. Under this husk there is another very hard, and
               thicker than that of a walnut. They burn this second rind, and make with it a powder
               which is useful to them. Under this rind there is a white marrow of a finger's
               thickness, which they eat fresh with meat and fish, as we do bread, and it has the
               taste of an almond, and if anyone dried it he might make bread of it. From the middle
               of this marrow there comes out a clear sweet water, and very cordial, which, when it
               has rested a little, and settled, congeals and becomes like an apple. When they wish
               to make oil they take this fruit, the coco, and let it get rotten, and they corrupt
               this marrow in the water, then they boil it, and it becomes oil in the manner of
               butter. When they want to make vinegar, they let the water in the cocoa-nut get bad,
               and they put it in the sun, when it turns to vinegar like white wine. From this fruit
               milk also can be made, as we experienced, for we scraped this marrow and then put it
               with its water, and passed it through a cloth, and thus it was milk like that of
               goats. This kind of palm tree is like the date-palm, but not so rugged. Two of these
               trees can maintain a family of ten persons: but they do not draw wine as
               above-mentioned always from one tree, but draw from one for eight days, and from the
               other as long. For if they did not, otherwise the trees would dry up. In this manner
               they last a hundred years.</p>
            <p>These people became very familiar and friendly with us, and explained many things to
               us in their language, and told us the names of some islands which we saw with our
               eyes before us. *The island where they dwelt is called <span class="placeName"
                  >Zuluam</span>, and it is not large. * As they were sufficiently agreeable and
               conversible we had great pleasure with them. The captain seeing that they were of
               this good condition, to do them greater honour conducted them to the ship, and showed
               them all his goods, that is to say, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg,
               mace,gold and all that was in the ship. He also had some shots fired with his
               artillery, at which they were so much afraid that they wished to jump from the ship
               into the sea. They made signs that the things which the captain had shown them grew
               there where we were going. When they wished to leave us they took leave of the
               captain and of us with very good manners and gracefulness, promising us to come back
               to see us. The island we were at was named Humunu; nevertheless because we found
               there two springs of very fresh water we named it the Watering Place of good signs,
               and because we found here the first signs of gold. There is much white coral to be
               found here, and large trees which bear fruit smaller than an almond, and which are
               like pines. There were also many palm trees both good and bad. In this place there
               were many circumjacent islands, on which account we named them the archipelago of St.
               Lazarus, because we stayed there on the day and feast of St. Lazarus. This region and
               archipelago is in ten degrees north latitude, and a hundred and sixty-one degrees
               longitude from the line of demarcation.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Friday, the 22nd of March</span>, the above-mentioned people, who
               had promised us to return, came about midday, with two boats laden with the said
               fruit cochi, sweet oranges, a vessel of palm wine, and a cock, to give us to
               understand that they had poultry in their country, so that we bought all that they
               brought. The lord of these people was old, and had his face painted, and had gold
               rings suspended to his ears, which they name Schione, and the others had many
               bracelets and rings of gold on their arms, with a wrapper of linen round their head.
               We remained at this place eight days: the captain went there every day to see his
               sick men, whom he had placed on this island to refresh them: and he gave them himself
               every day the water of this said fruit the cocho, which comforted them much. Near
               this isle is another where there are a kind of people who wear holes in their ears so
               large that they can pass their arms through them; these people are Caphre, that is to
               say, <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, and they go naked, except that round
               their middles they wear cloth made of the bark of trees. But there are some of the
               more remarkable of them who wear cotton stuff, and at the end of it there is some
               work of silk done with a needle. These people are tawny, fat, and painted, and they
               anoint themselves with the oil of coco nuts and sesame, to preserve them from the sun
               and the wind. Their hair is very black and long, reaching to the waist, and they
               carry small daggers and knives, ornamented with gold, and many other things, such as
               darts, harpoons, and nets to fish, like. , and their boats are like ours.</p>
            <p><span class="date">The Monday of Passion week, the 25th of March,</span> and feast of
               our Lady, in the afternoon, and being ready to depart from this place, I went to the
               side of our ship to fish, and putting my feet on a spar to go down to the store room,
               my feet slipped, because it had rained, and I fell into the sea without any one
               seeing me, and being near drowning by luck I found at my left hand the sheet of the
               large sail which was in the sea, I caught hold of it and began to cry out till they
               came to help and pick me up with the boat. I was assisted not by my merits, but by
               the mercy and grace of the fountain of pity. That same day we took the course between
               west and southwest, and passed amidst four small islands, that is to say, Cenalo,
               Huinanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Thursday, the 28th of March</span>, having seen the night before
               fire upon an island, at the morning we came to anchor at this island; where we saw a
               small boat which they call Boloto, with eight men inside, which approached the ship
               of the captain-general. Then a slave of the captain's, who was from Sumatra,
               otherwise named Traprobana, spoke from afar to these people, who understood his talk,
               and came near to the side of the ship, but they withdrew immediately, and would not
               enter the ship from fear of us. So the captain seeing that they would not trust to us
               showed them a red cap, and other things, which he had tied and placed on a little
               plank, and the people in the boat took them immediately and joyously, and then
               returned to advise their king. Two hours afterwards, or thereabouts, we saw come two
               long boats, which they call Ballanghai, full of men. In the largest of them was their
               king sitting under an awning of mats; when they were near the ship of the
               captain-general, the said slave spoke to the king, who understood him well, because
               in these countries the kings know more languages than the common people. Then the
               king ordered some of his people to go to the captain's ship, whilst he would not move
               from his boat, which was near enough to us. This was done, and when his people
               returned to the boat, he went away at once. The captain gave good entertainment to
               the men who came to his ship, and gave them all sorts of things, on which account the
               king wished to give the captain a rather large bar of solid gold, and a chest full of
               ginger. However, the captain thanked him very much but would not accept the present.
               After that, when it was late, we went with the ships near to the houses and abode of
               the king.</p>
            <p>The next day which was Good Friday, the captain sent on shore the before-mentioned
               slave, who was our interpreter, to the king to beg him to give him for money some
               provisions for his ships, sending him word that he had not come to his country as an
               enemy, but as a friend. The king on hearing this came with seven or eight men in a
               boat, and entered the ship, and embraced the captain, and gave him three china dishes
               covered with leaves full of rice, and two dorades, which are rather large fish, and
               of the sort above-mentioned, and he gave him several other things. The captain gave
               this king a robe of red and yellow cloth, made in the <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Turkish</span> fashion, and a very fine red cap, and to his people he gave to
               some of them knives, and to others mirrors. After that refreshments were served up to
               them. The captain told the king, through the said interpreter, that he wished to be
               with him, cassi cassi, that is to say, brothers. To which the king answered that he
               desired to be the same towards him. After that the captain showed him cloths of
               different colours, linen, coral, and much other merchandise, and all the artillery,
               of which he had some pieces fired before him, at which the king was much astonished;
               after that the captain had one of his soldiers armed with white armour, and placed
               him in the midst of three comrades, who struck him with swords and daggers. The king
               thought this very strange, and the captain told him, through the interpreter, that a
               man thus in white armour was worth a hundred of his men; he answered that it was
               true; he was further informed that there were in each ship two hundred like that man.
               After that the captain showed him a great number of swords, cuirasses, and helmets,
               and made two of the men play with their swords before the king; he then showed him
               the sea chart and the ship compass, and informed him how he had found the strait to
               come there, and of the time which he had spent in coming; also of the time he had
               been without seeing any land, at which the king was astonished. At the end the
               captain asked if he would be pleased that two of his people should go with him to the
               places where they lived, to see some of the things of his country. This the king
               granted, and I went with another.</p>
            <p>When I had landed, the king raised his hands to the sky, and turned to us two, and we
               did the same as he did; after that he took me by the hand, and one of his principal
               people took my companion, and led us under a place covered with canes, where there
               was a ballanghai, that is to say, a boat, eighty feet long or thereabouts, resembling
               a fusta. We sat with the king upon its poop, always conversing with him by signs, and
               his people stood up around us, with their swords, spears, and bucklers. Then the king
               ordered to be brought a dish of pig's flesh and wine. Their fashion of drinking is in
               this wise, they first raise their hands to heaven, then take the drinking vessel in
               their right hand, and extend the left hand closed towards the people. This the king
               did, and presented to me his fist, so that I thought that he wanted to strike me; I
               did the same thing towards him; so with this ceremony, and other signs of friendship,
               we banqueted, and afterwards supped with him.</p>
            <p>I ate flesh on Good Friday, not being able to do otherwise, and before the hour of
               supper, I gave several things to the king, which I had brought. There I wrote down
               several things as they name them in their language, and when the king and the others
               saw me write, and I told them their manner of speech, they were all astonished. When
               the hour for supper had come, they brought two large china dishes, of which one was
               full of rice, and the other of pig's flesh, with its broth and sauce. We supped with
               the same signs and ceremonies, and then went to the king's palace, which was made and
               built like a hay grange, covered with fig and palm leaves. It was built on great
               timbers high above the ground, and it was necessary to go up steps and ladders to it.
               Then the king made us sit on a cane mat, with our legs doubled as was the custom;
               after half an hour there was brought a dish of fish roast in pieces, and ginger fresh
               gathered that moment, and some wine. The eldest son of the king, who was the prince,
               came where we were, and the king told him to sit down near us, which he did; then two
               dishes were brought, one of fish, with its sauce, and the other of rice, and this was
               done for us to eat with the prince. My companion enjoyed the food and drink so much
               that he got drunk. They use for candles or torches the gum of a tree which is named
               Animé, wrapped up in leaves of palms or fig trees. The king made a sign that he
               wished to go to rest, and left with us the prince, with whom we slept on a cane mat,
               with some cushions and pillows of leaves. Next morning the king came and took me by
               the hand, and so we went to the place where we had supped, to breakfast, but the boat
               came to fetch us. The king, before we went away, was very gay, and kissed our hands,
               and we kissed his. There came with us a brother of his, the king of another island,
               accompanied by three men. The captain-general detained him to dine with us, and we
               gave him several things.</p>
            <p>In the island belonging to the king who came to the ship there are mines of gold,
               which they find in pieces as big as a walnut or an egg, by seeking in the ground. All
               the vessels which he makes use of are made of it, and also some parts of his house,
               which was well fitted up according to the custom of the country, and he was the
               handsomest man that we saw among these nations. He had very black hair coming down to
               his shoulders, with a silk cloth on his head, and two large gold rings hanging from
               his ears, he had a cloth of cotton worked with silk, which covered him from the waist
               to the knees, at his side he wore a dagger, with a long handle which was all of gold,
               its sheath was of carved wood. Besides he carried upon him scents of storax and
               benzoin. He was tawny and painted all over. The island of this king is named Zuluan
               and Calagan, and when these two kings wish to visit one another they come to hunt in
               this island where we were. Of these kings the painted king is called Raia Calambu,
               and the other Raia Siani.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, the last day of March, and feast of Easter, the captain sent the chaplain
               ashore early to say mass, and the interpreter went with him to tell the king that
               they were not coming on shore to dine with him, but only to hear the mass. The king
               hearing that sent two dead pigs. When it was time for saying mass the captain went
               ashore with fifty men, not with their arms, but only with their swords, and dressed
               as well as each one was able to dress, and before the boats reached the shore our
               ships fired six cannon shots as a sign of peace. At our landing the two kings were
               there, and received our captain in a friendly manner, and placed him between them,
               and then we went to the place prepared for saying mass, which was not far from the
               shore. Before the mass began the captain threw a quantity of musk rose water on those
               two kings, and when the offertory of the mass came, the two kings went to kiss the
               cross like us, but they offered nothing, and at the elevation of the body of our Lord
               they were kneeling like us, and adored our Lord with joined hands. The ships fired
               all their artillery at the elevation of the body of our Lord. After mass had been
               said each one did the duty of a Christian, receiving our Lord. After that the captain
               had some sword-play by his people, which gave great pleasure to the kings. Then he
               had a cross brought, with the nails and crown, to which the kings made reverence, and
               the captain had them told that these things which he showed them were the sign of the
               emperor his lord and master, from whom he had charge and commandment to place it in
               all places where he might go or pass by. He told them that he wished to place it in
               their country for their profit, because if there came afterwards any ships from <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span> to those islands, on seeing this cross, they would
               know that we had been there, and therefore they would not cause them any displeasure
               to their persons nor their goods; and if they took any of their people, on showing
               them this sign, they would at once let them go. Besides this, the captain told them
               that it was necessary that this cross should be placed on the summit of the highest
               mountain in their country, so that seeing it every day they might adore it, and that
               if they did thus, neither thunder, lightning, nor the tempest could do them hurt. The
               kings thanked the captain, and said they would do it willingly. Then he asked whether
               they were <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> or <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Gentiles</span>, and in what they believed. They answered that they did not
               perform any other adoration, but only joined their hands, looking up to heaven, and
               that they called their God, Aba. Hearing this, the captain was very joyful, on seeing
               that, the first king raised his hands to the sky and said that he wished it were
               possible for him to be able to show the affection which he felt towards him. The
               interpreter asked him for what reason there was so little to eat in that place, to
               which the king replied that he did not reside in that place except when he came to
               hunt and to see his brother, but that he lived in another island where he had all his
               family. Then the captain asked him if he had any enemies who made war upon him, and
               that if he had any he would go and defeat them with his men and ships, to put them
               under his obedience. The king thanked him, and answered that there were two islands
               the inhabitants of which were his enemies; however, that for the present it was not
               the time to attack them. The captain therefore said to him that if God permitted him
               to return another time to this country, he would bring so many men that he would put
               them by force under his obedience. Then he bade the interpreter tell them that he was
               going away to dine, and after that he would return to place the cross on the summit
               of the mountain. The two kings said they were content, and on that they embraced the
               captain, and he separated from them.</p>
            <p>After dinner we all returned in our dress coats, and we went together with the two
               kings to the middle of the highest mountain we could find, and there the cross was
               planted. After that the two kings and the captain rested themselves; and, while
               conversing, I asked where was the best port for obtaining victuals. They replied that
               there were three, that is to say, Ceylon, Zzubu, and Calaghan, but that Zzubu was the
               largest and of the most traffic. Then the kings offered to give him pilots to go to
               those ports, for which he thanked them, and deliberated to go there, for his
               ill-fortune would have it so. After the cross had been planted on that mountain, each
               one said the Paternoster and Ave Maria, and adored it, and the kings did the like.
               Then we went down below to where their boats were. There the kings had brought some
               of the fruit called cocos and other things to make a collation and to refresh us. The
               captain, being desirous to depart the next day in the morning, asked the king for the
               pilots to conduct us to the above-mentioned ports, promising him to treat them like
               themselves, and that he would leave one of his own men as a hostage. The first king
               said that he would go himself and conduct him to this port, and be his pilots but
               that he should wait two days, until he had had his rice gathered in and done other
               things which he had to do, begging him to lend him some of his men so as to get done
               sooner. This the captain agreed to.</p>
            <p>This kind of people are gentle, and go naked, and are painted. They wear a piece of
               cloth made from a tree, like a linen cloth, round their body to cover their natural
               parts: they are great drinkers. The women are dressed in tree cloth from their waists
               downwards; their hair is black, and reaches down to the ground; they wear certain
               gold rings in their ears. These people chew most of their time a fruit which they
               call areca, which is something of the shape of a pear; they cut it in four quarters,
               and after they have chewed it for a long time they spit it out, from which afterwards
               they have their mouths very red. They find themselves the better from the use of this
               fruit because it refreshes them much, for this country is very hot, so that they
               could not live without it. In this island there is a great quantity of dogs, cats,
               pigs, fowls, and goats, rice, ginger, cocos, figs, oranges, lemons, millet, wax, and
               gold mines. This island is in nine degrees and two-thirds north latitude, and one
               hundred and sixty-two longitude from the line of demarcation: it is twenty-five
               leagues distant from the other island where we found the two fountains of fresh
               water. This island is named <span class="placeName">Mazzava</span>.</p>
            <p>We remained seven days in this place; then we took the tack of Maestral, passing
               through the midst of five isles, that is to say, <span class="placeName"
                  >Ceylon</span>, <span class="placeName">Bohol</span>, <span class="placeName"
                  >Canighan</span>, <span class="placeName">Baibai</span>, and <span
                  class="placeName">Satighan</span>. In this island of Satighan is a kind of bird
               called Barbastigly, which are as large as eagles. Of these we killed only one,
               because it was late. We ate it, and it had the taste of a fowl. There are also in
               this island doves, tortoises, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl,
               with a long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose. These they put a good
               arm's length under the sand in the sun, where they are hatched by the great heat
               which the heated sand gives out; and when these birds are hatched they push up the
               sand and come out. These eggs are good to eat. From this island of Mazzabua to that
               of Satighan there are twenty leagues, and on leaving Satighan we went by the west;
               but the King of Mazzabua could not follow us; therefore we waited for him near three
               islands, that is to say. Polo, Ticobon, and Pozzon. When the king arrived he was much
               astonished at our navigation, the captain-general bade him come on board his ship
               with some of his principal people, at which they were much pleased. Thus we went to
               Zzubu, which is fifteen leagues off from Satighan.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Sunday, the 7th of April</span>, about midday, we entered the port
               of <span class="placeName">Zzubu</span>, having passed by many villages. There we saw
               many houses which were built on trees. On approaching the principal town the
               captain-general commanded all his ships to hang out their flags. Then we lowered the
               sails in the fashion in which they are struck when going to fight, and he had all the
               artillery fired, at which the people of this place were greatly frightened. The
               captain sent a young man whom he had brought up, with the interpreter to the king of
               this island Zzubu. These having come to the town, found a great number of people and
               their king with them, all alarmed by the artillery which had been fired. But the
               interpreter reassured them, saying that it was the fashion and custom to fire
               artillery when they arrived at ports, to show signs of peace and friendship; and
               also, to do more honour to the king of the country, they had fired all the artillery.
               The king and all his people were reassured. He then bade one of his principal men ask
               what we were seeking. The interpreter answered him that his master was captain of the
               greatest king in the world, and that he was going by the command of the said
               sovereign to discover the Molucca islands. However, on account of what he had heard
               where he had passed, and especially from the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Mazzava</span>, of his courtesy and good fame, he had wished to pass by his
               country to visit him, and also to obtain some refreshment of victuals for his
               merchandise. The king answered him that he was welcome, but that the custom was that
               all ships which arrived at his country or port paid tribute, and it was only four
               days since that a ship called the Junk of Ciama, laden with gold and slaves, had paid
               him his tribute, and, to verify what he said, he showed them a merchant of the said
               Ciama, who had remained there to trade with the gold and slaves. The interpreter said
               to him that this captain, on account of being captain of so great a king as his was,
               would not pay tribute to any sovereign in the world; and that if he wished for peace
               he would have peace, and if he wished for war he would have war. Then the merchant
               above-mentioned replied to the king in his own language, "Look well, oh king, what
               you will do, for these people are of those who have conquered Calicut, Malacca, and
               all greater India; if you entertain them well and treat them well you will find
               yourself the better for it, and if ill, it will be so much the worse for you, as they
               have done at Calicut and Malacca." The interpreter, who understood all this
               discourse, said to them that the king, his master, was a good deal more powerful in
               ships and by land than the King of Portugal, and declared to him that he was the King
               of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> and Emperor of all Christendom, wherefore, if
               he would not be his friend and treat his subjects well, he would another time send
               against him so many men as to destroy him. Then the king answered that he would speak
               to his council, and give an answer the next day. Afterwards the king ordered a
               collation to be brought of several viands, all of meat, in porcelain dishes, with a
               great many vessels of wine. When the repast was over, our people returned, and
               related all to the captain; and the King of Mazzabua, who was on board the captain's
               ship, and who was the first king after him of Zzubu, and the lord of several isles,
               wished to go on shore to relate to the king the politeness and courtesy of our
               captain.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday</span> morning our clerk went with the interpreter to the
               town of Zzubu, and the king, accompanied by the principal men of his kingdom, came to
               the open space, where we made our people sit down near him, and he asked whether
               there was more than one captain in all those ships, and whether he wished that the
               king should pay tribute to the emperor, his master, to which our people answered, no,
               but that the captain only wished to trade with the things which he had brought with
               the people of his country, and not with others. Then the king said that he was
               content, and as a greater sign of affection he sent him a little of his blood from
               his right arm, and wished he should do the like. Our people answered that he would do
               it. Besides that, he said that all the captains who came to his country had been
               accustomed to make a present to him, and he to them, and therefore they should ask
               their captain if he would observe the custom. Our people answered that he would; but
               as the king wished to keep up the custom, let him begin and make a present, and then
               the captain would do his duty.</p>
            <p>Tuesday morning following the King of <span class="placeName">Mazzava</span>, with
               the Moor, came to the ship, and saluted the captain on behalf of the King of Zzubu,
               and said that the king was preparing a quantity of provisions, as much as he could,
               to make a present of to him, and that after dinner he would send two of his nephews,
               with others of his principal people, to make peace with him. Then the captain had one
               of his men armed with his own armour, and told him that all of us would fight armed
               in that manner, at which the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moorish</span> merchant was
               rather astonished; but the captain told him not to be afraid, and that our arms were
               soft to our friends and rough to our enemies; and that as a cloth wipes away the
               sweat from a man, so our arms destroy the enemies of our faith. The captain said this
               to the Moor, because he was more intelligent than the others, and for him to relate
               it all to the King of Zzubu.</p>
            <p>After dinner, the nephew of this king, who was a prince, with the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Mazzava</span>, the Moor, the governor, and the chief of
               police,and eight of the principal men, came to the ship to make peace with us. The
               captain-general was sitting in a chair of red velvet, and near him were the principal
               men of the ships sitting in leather chairs, and the others on the ground on mats.
               Then the captain bade the interpreter ask the above-mentioned persons if it was their
               custom to speak in secret or in public, and whether the prince who was come with them
               had power to conclude peace. They answered yes, that they would speak in public, and
               that they had the power to conclude peace. The captain spoke at length on the subject
               of peace, and prayed God to confirm it in heaven. These people replied that they had
               never heard such words as these which the captain had spoken to them, and they took
               great pleasure in hearing them. The captain, seeing then that those people listened
               willingly to what was said to them, and that they gave good answers, began to say a
               great many more good things to induce them to become <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Christians</span>. After many other subjects, the captain asked them who would
               succeed the king in their country after his death. They answered that the king had no
               son, but several daughters, and that this prince was his nephew, and had for a wife
               the king's eldest daughter, and for the sake of that they called him prince. They
               also said that when the father and mother were old they took no further account of
               them, but their children commanded them. Upon which the captain told them how God had
               made heaven and earth and all other things in the world, and that He had commanded
               that everyone should render honour and obedience to his father and mother, and that
               whoever did otherwise was condemned to eternal fire. He then pointed out to them many
               other things concerning our faith. The people heard these things willingly, and
               besought the captain to leave them two men to teach and show them the Christian
               faith, and they would entertain them well with great honour. To this the captain
               answered that for the moment he could not leave them any of his people, but that if
               they wished to be <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> that his priest would
               baptise them, and that another time he would bring priests and preachers to teach
               them the faith. They then answered that they wished first to speak to their king, and
               then would become <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>. Each of us wept for
               the joy which we felt at the goodwill of these people, and the captain told them not
               to become <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> from fear of us, or to please
               us, but that if they wished to become Christian they must do it willingly, and for
               the love of God, for even though they should not become Christian, no displeasure
               would be done them, but those who became Christian would be more loved and better
               treated than the others. Then they all cried out with one voice, that they did not
               wish to become <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> from fear, nor from
               complaisance, but of their free will. The captain then said that if they became <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> he would leave them the arms which the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> use, and that his king had commanded him so
               to do. At last they said they did not know what more to answer to so many good and
               beautiful words which he spoke to them, but that they placed themselves in his hands,
               and that he should do with them as with his own servants. Then the captain, with
               tears in his eyes, embraced them, and, taking the hand of the prince and that of the
               king, said to him that by the faith he had in God, and to his master the emperor, and
               by the habit of St. James which he wore, he promised them to cause them to have
               perpetual peace with the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, at which the
               prince and the others promised him the same. After peace had been concluded, the
               captain had refreshments served to them. The prince and the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Mazzava</span>, who was with him, presented to the captain on
               behalf of his king large baskets full of rice, pigs, goats, and fowls, and desired
               the captain to be told he should pardon them that their present was not as fine as
               was fitting for him. The captain gave to the prince some very fine cloth and a red
               cap, and a quantity of glass and a cup of gilt glass. Glasses are much prized in this
               country. To the other people belonging to the Prince he gave various things. Then he
               sent by me and another person to the King of Zzubu a robe of yellow and violet silk
               in the fashion of a <span class="ethnicGroup">Turkish</span> jubbeh, a red cap, very
               fine, and certain pieces of glass, and had all of them put in a silver dish, and two
               gilt glasses.</p>
            <p>When we came to the town we found the King of Zzubu at his palace, sitting on the
               ground on a mat made of palm, with many people about him. He was quite naked, except
               that he had a cloth round his middle, and a loose wrapper round his head, worked with
               silk by the needle. He had a very heavy chain round his neck, and two gold rings hung
               in his ears with precious stones. He was a small and fat man, and his face was
               painted with fire in different ways. He was eating on the ground on another palm mat,
               and was then eating tortoise eggs in two china dishes, and he had four vessels full
               of palm wine, which he drank with a cane pipe. We made our obeisance, and presented
               to him what the captain had sent him, and told him through the interpreter that it
               was not as a return for his present which he had sent to the captain, but for the
               affection which he bore him. That done, his people told him all the good words and
               explanations of peace and religion which he had spoken to them. The king wished to
               detain us to supper, but we made our excuses and took leave of him. The prince,
               nephew of the king, conducted us to his house, and showed us four girls who played on
               four instruments, which were strange and very soft, and their manner of playing is
               rather musical. Afterwards he made us dance with them. These girls were naked except
               from the waist to the knees, where they wore a wrap made of the palm tree cloth,
               which covered their middles, and some were quite naked. There we made a repast, and
               then returned to the ships.</p>
            <p>Wednesday morning, because the night before one of our men had died, the interpreter
               and I, by order of the captain, went to ask the king for a place where we might bury
               the deceased. We found the king accompanied by a good many people, and, after paying
               him due honour, we told him of the death of our man, and that the captain prayed him
               that he might be put into the ground. He replied that if he and his people were ready
               to obey our master, still more reason was there for his land and country being
               subject to him. After that we said we wished to consecrate the grave in our fashion
               and place a cross on it. The sovereign said that he was content, and that he would
               worship that cross as we did. The deceased was buried in the middle of the open space
               of the town, as decently as possible, and performing the above-mentioned ceremonies
               to set them a good example, and in the evening we buried another. This done, we
               brought a good quantity of merchandise into the town of this <span class="rank"
                  >king</span>, and placed it in a house, and he took it under his charge and
               promised that no one would do harm or injury to the king. Four of our men were chosen
               to despatch and sell this merchandise. These people live with justice, and good
               weight and measure, loving peace, and are people who love ease and pleasure. They
               have wooden scales, after the fashion of those of north of the Loire, for weighing
               their merchandise. Their houses are made of wood and beams and canes, founded on
               piles, and are very high, and must be entered by means of ladders; their rooms are
               like ours, and underneath they keep their cattle, such as pigs, goats, and fowls. The
               young people sound bag-pipes, made like ours, and call them Subin.</p>
            <p>In this island of the king's there is a kind of animal carrying a shell called
               carniolle, fine to look at, which cause the whale to die. For the whale swallows them
               alive; then, when they are inside its body, they come out of their shell and go and
               eat the whale's heart: and the people of this country find this animal alive inside
               the whale. These animals, the carniolles, have the teeth and skin black, and their
               shell is white. Their flesh is good to eat, and they call them Laghan.</p>
            <p>The following Friday we showed them a shop full of our merchandise, which was of
               various strange sorts, at which they were surprised. For metal, iron, and other big
               goods they gave us gold, and for the other small and sundry goods they gave us rice,
               pigs, goats, and other provisions. They gave us ten weights of gold for fourteen
               pounds of iron: each weight is a ducat and a half. The captain-general would not
               allow a large quantity of gold to be taken, so that the sailors should not sell what
               belonged to them too cheap from thirst for gold, and lest by that means he might be
               constrained to do likewise with his merchandise, for he wished to sell it better.</p>
            <p>Saturday following a scaffolding was made in the open space, fitted with tapestry and
               palm branches, because the king had promised our captain to become Christian on
               Sunday. He told him not to be afraid when our artillery fired on that day, for it was
               the custom to load it on those feasts without firing stones or other balls.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Sunday morning, the fourteenth day of April</span>, we went on
               shore, forty men, of whom two were armed, who marched before us, following the
               standard of our king emperor. When we landed the ships discharged all their
               artillery, and from fear of it the people ran away in all directions. The captain and
               the king embraced one another, and then joyously we went near the scaffolding, where
               the captain and the king sat on two chairs, one covered with red, the other with
               violet velvet. The principal men sat on cushions, and the others on mats, after the
               fashion of the country. Then the captain began to speak to the king through the
               interpreter to incite him to the faith of <span class="persName">Jesus Christ</span>,
               and told him that if he wished to be a good Christian, as he had said the day before,
               that he must burn all the idols of his country, and, instead of them, place a cross,
               and that everyone should worship it every day on their knees, and their hands joined
               to heaven: and he showed him how he ought every day to make the sign of the cross. To
               that the king and all his people answered that they would obey the commands of the
               captain and do all that he told them. The captain took the king by the hand, and they
               walked about on the scaffolding, and when he was baptised he said that he would name
               him Don Charles, as the emperor his sovereign was named; and he named the prince Don
               Fernand, after the brother of the emperor, and the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Mazzava</span> Jehan: to the Moor he gave the name of Christopher, and to the
               others each a name of his fancy. Thus, before mass, there were fifty men baptised.
               After mass had been heard the captain invited the king and his other principal men to
               dine with him, but he would not. He accompanied the captain, however, to the beach,
               and on his arrival there the ships fired all their artillery. Then, embracing one
               another, they took leave.</p>
            <p>After dinner our chaplain and some of us went on shore to baptise the queen. She came
               with forty ladies, and we conducted them on to the scaffolding; then made her sit
               down on a cushion, and her women around her, until the priest was ready. During that
               time they showed her an image of our Lady, of wood, holding her little child, which
               was very well made, and a cross. When she saw it, she had a greater desire to be a
               Christian, and, asking for baptism, she was baptised and named Jehanne, like the
               mother of the emperor. The wife of the prince, daughter of this queen, had the name
               of <span class="persName">Catherine</span>, the Queen of <span class="placeName"
                  >Mazzava Isabella</span>, and the others each their name. That day we baptised
               eight hundred persons of men, women, and children. The Queen was young and handsome,
               covered with a black and white sheet; she had the mouth and nails very red, and wore
               on her head a large hat made of leaves of palm, with a crown over it made of the same
               leaves, like that of the Pope. After that she begged us to give her the little wooden
               boy to put in the place of the idols. This we did, and she went away. In the evening
               the king and queen, with several of their people, came to the sea beach, where the
               captain had some of the large artillery fired, in which they took great pleasure. The
               captain and the king called one another brother.</p>
            <p>At last, in eight days, all the inhabitants of this island were baptised, and some
               belonging to the neighbouring islands. In one of these we burned a village because
               the inhabitants would not obey either the king or us. There we planted a cross
               because the people were <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>: if they had been
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span>, we should have erected a column, as a sign
               of their hardness of heart, because the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> are
               more difficult to convert than the <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>. The
               captain-general went ashore every day to hear mass, to which there came many of the
               new <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>, to whom he explained various points
               of our religion. One day the queen came with all her state. She was preceded by three
               damsels, who carried in their hands three of her hats: she was dressed in black and
               white, with a large silk veil with gold stripes, which covered her head and
               shoulders. Very many women followed her, with their heads covered with a small veil,
               and a hat above that: the rest of their bodies and feet were naked, except a small
               wrapper of palm cloth which covered their natural parts. Their hair fell flowing over
               their shoulders. The queen, after making a bow to the altar, sat upon a cushion of
               embroidered silk, and the captain sprinkled over her and over some of her ladies rose
               water and musk, a perfume which pleases the ladies of this country very much. The
               captain on that occasion approved of the gift which I had made to the queen of the
               image of the Infant Jesus, and recommended her to put it in the place of her idols,
               because it was a remembrancer of the Son of God. She promised to do all this, and to
               keep it with much care.</p>
            <p>In order that the king might be more respected and obeyed, the captain-general got
               him to come one day at the hour of mass with his silk robe, and summoned his two
               brothers, one named Bondara, who was the father of the prince, and the other named
               Cadaro, and some of his chief men, whose names were Simiut, Sibuaia, Sisacai,
               Magalibe, and others whom it is unnecessary to name separately; and he made them all
               swear to be obedient to their king, whose hand they all of them kissed. He then asked
               the king to swear that he would always be obedient and faithful to the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>, and he took the oath. Then the captain drew a
               sword before the image of the <span class="persName">Virgin Mary</span>, and said to
               the king that when such an oath had been taken by anyone, he should rather die than
               be wanting to his oath. After that he himself promised to be always faithful to him,
               swearing by the image of our Lady, by the life of the emperor his sovereign, and by
               the habit which he wore. He then made a present to the king of a velvet chair, and
               told him that wherever he went he should always have it carried before him by some of
               his attendants, and showed him the way in which it should be carried. The king told
               the captain that he would do all this on account of the affection which he bore him,
               of which he wished to give him a token, preparing for that purpose some jewels to
               present to him; these were two rather large gold rings for the ears, two others for
               the arms, and two for the ancles, all of them adorned with precious stones. The
               finest ornaments of the kings of these countries consist in these rings, for
               otherwise they go naked and barefooted, with only a piece of cloth from the waist to
               the knees.</p>
            <p>The captain-general, who had informed the king and all those who had been baptised of
               the obligation they were under of burning their idols, which they had promised to do,
               seeing that they retained them and made them offerings of meat, reproved them
               severely for it. They thought to excuse themselves sufficiently by saying that they
               did not do that now on their own account, but for a sick person, for the idols to
               restore him his health. This sick man was a brother of the prince, and was reputed to
               be the most valiant and wise man in the island, and his illness was so severe that
               for four days he had not spoken. Having heard this, the captain, seized with zeal for
               religion, said that if they had a true faith in <span class="persName">Jesus
                  Christ</span>, they should burn all the idols, and the sick man should be
               baptised, and he would be immediately cured, of which he was so certain that he
               consented to lose his head if the miracle did not take place. The king promised that
               all this should be done, because he truly believed in <span class="persName">Jesus
                  Christ</span>. Then we arranged, with all the pomp that was possible, a procession
               from the place to the house of the sick man. We went there, and indeed found him
               unable to speak or to move. We baptised him, with two of his wives and ten girls. The
               captain then asked him how he felt, and he at once spoke, and said that by the grace
               of Our Lord he was well enough. This great miracle was done under our eyes. The
               captain, on hearing him speak, gave great thanks to God. He gave him a refreshing
               drink to take, and afterwards sent to his house a mattress, two sheets, a covering of
               yellow wool, and a cushion, and he continued to send him, until he was quite well,
               refreshing drinks of almonds, rosewater, rosoglio, and some sweet preserves.</p>
            <p>On the fifth day the convalescent rose from his bed, and as soon as he could walk, he
               had burned, in the presence of the king and of all the people, an idol which some old
               women had concealed in his house. He also caused to be destroyed several temples
               constructed on the sea shore, in which people were accustomed to eat the meat offered
               to the idols. The inhabitants applauded this, and, shouting "<span class="placeName"
                  >Castile</span>, <span class="placeName">Castile</span>," helped to throw them
               down, and declared that if God gave them life they would burn all the idols they
               could find, even if they were in the king's own house.</p>
            <p>These idols are made of wood, they are concave or hollowed out behind, they have the
               arms and legs spread out, and the feet turned upwards; they have a large face, with
               four very large teeth like those of a wild boar, and they are all painted.</p>
            <p>Since I have spoken of the idols, it may please your illustrious Highness to have an
               account of the ceremony with which, in this island, they bless the pig. They begin by
               sounding some great drums (tamburi), they then bring three large dishes, two are
               filled with cakes of rice and cooked millet rolled up in leaves, and roast fish, in
               the third are Cambay clothes, and two strips of palm cloth. A cloth of Cambay is
               spread out on the ground: then two old women come, each of whom has in her hand a
               reed trumpet. They step upon the cloth and make an obeisance to the Sun: they then
               clothe themselves with the above mentioned cloths. The first of these puts on her
               head a handkerchief which she ties on her forehead so as to make two horns, and
               taking another handkerchief in her hand, dances and sounds her trumpet, and invokes
               the Sun. The second old woman takes one of the strips of palm cloth, and dances, and
               also sounds her trumpet; thus they dance and sound their trumpets for a short space
               of time, saying several things to the sun. The first old woman then drops the
               handkerchief she has in her hand, and takes the other strip of cloth, and both
               together sounding their trumpets, dance for a long time round the pig which is bound
               on the ground. The first one always speaks in a low tone to the sun, and the second
               answers her. The second old woman then presents a cup of wine to the first, who,
               whilst they both continue their address to the sun, brings the cup four or five times
               near her mouth as though going to drink, and meanwhile sprinkles the wine on the
               heart of the pig. She then gives up the cup, and receives a lance which she
               brandishes, whilst still dancing and reciting, and four or five times directs the
               lance at the pig's heart, at last with a sudden and well aimed blow she pierces it
               through and through. She withdraws the lance from the wound, which is then closed and
               dressed with herbs. During the ceremony a torch is always burning, and the old woman
               who pierced the pig takes and puts it out with her mouth, the other old woman dips
               the end of her trumpet in the pig’s blood, and with it marks with blood the forehead
               of her husband, and of her companion, and then of the rest of the people. But they
               did not come and do this to us. That done the old women took off their robes, and ate
               what was in the two dishes, inviting only women to join them. After that they get the
               hair off the pig with fire. Only old women are able to consecrate the boar in this
               manner, and this animal is never eaten unless it is killed in this manner.</p> (Here
            follows an account of a custom, for a description of which see De Morga’s Philippine
            Islands, p. 304.) <p>When our people went on shore by day or by night, they always met
               with some one who invited them to eat and drink. They only half cook their victuals,
               and salt them very much, which makes them drink a great deal; and they drink much
               with reeds, sucking the wine from the vessels. Their repasts always last from five to
               six hours.</p>
            <p>When one of their chiefs dies they always use the following funeral ceremonies, of
               which I was witness. The most respected women of the country came to the house of the
               deceased, in the midst of which lay the corpse in a chest; round which were stretched
               cords after the manner of an enclosure, and many branches of trees were tied to these
               cords: a strip of cotton was fastened to each of these branches like a pennant. Under
               these the women I have mentioned sat down covered with white cotton cloth. Each of
               them had a damsel who fanned her with a palm fan. The other women sat sadly round the
               room. Meanwhile a woman cut off by degrees the hair of the dead man with a knife:
               another who had been his principal wife, lay extended on him, with her mouth hands
               and feet on the mouth hands and feet of the dead man. When the first woman cut off
               the hair, she wept, and when she stopped cutting, she sung. Round the room there were
               many vases of porcelain, with embers in them, on which, from time to time, they threw
               myrrh, storax, and benzoin, which gave out a good and strong smell in the room. These
               ceremonies last for five or six days, during which the corpse is kept in the house,
               and I believe that they anoint it with oil of camphor to preserve it. They afterwards
               put it in a chest, closed with wooden bolts, and place it in an enclosed place
               covered with logs of wood. The islanders told us that every evening towards midnight,
               there used to come to the city, a black bird of the size of a crow, which perching on
               the houses whistled, and caused all the dogs to howl, and these double cries lasted
               four or five hours. They would never tell us the cause of that phenomenon, of which
               we also were witnesses.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Friday, the 26th of April</span>, Zula, who was one of the
               principal men or chiefs of the island of <span class="placeName">Matan</span>, sent
               to the captain a son of his with two goats to make a present of them, and to say that
               if he did not do all that he had promised, the cause of that was another chief named
               Silapulapu, who would not in any way obey the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>, and had prevented him from doing so: but that if the captain would
               send him the following night one boat full of men to give him assistance, he would
               fight and subdue his rival. On the receipt of this message, the captain decided to go
               himself with three boats. We entreated him much not to go to this enterprise in
               person, but he as a good shepherd would not abandon his flock.</p>
            <p>We set out from <span class="placeName">Zubu</span> at midnight, we were sixty men
               armed with corslets and helmets; there were with us the Christian king, the prince,
               and some of the chief men, and many others divided among twenty or thirty balangai.
               We arrived at <span class="placeName">Matan</span> three hours before daylight. The
               captain before attacking wished to attempt gentle means, and sent on shore the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moorish</span> merchant to tell those islanders who were of
               the party of Cilapulapu, that if they would recognise the Christian king as their
               sovereign, and obey the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, and pay us the
               tribute which had been asked, the captain would become their friend, otherwise we
               should prove how our lances wounded. The islanders were not terrified, they replied
               that if we had lances, so also had they, although only of reeds, and wood hardened
               with fire. They asked however that we should not attack them by night, but wait for
               daylight, because they were expecting reinforcements, and would be in greater number.
               This they said with cunning, to excite us to attack them by night, supposing that we
               were ready; but they wished this because they had dug ditches between their houses
               and the beach, and they hoped that we should fall into them.</p>
            <p>We however waited for daylight; we then leaped into the water up to our thighs, for
               on account of the shallow water and the rocks the boats could not come close to the
               beach, and we had to cross two good crossbow shots through the water before reaching
               it. We were forty-nine in number, the other eleven remained in charge of the boats.
               When we reached land we found the islanders fifteen hundred in number, drawn up in
               three squadrons; they came down upon us with terrible shouts, two squadrons attacking
               us on the flanks, and the third in front. The captain then divided his men in two
               bands. Our musketeers and crossbow-men fired for half an hour from a distance, but
               did nothing, since the bullets and arrows, though they passed through their shields
               made of thin wood, and perhaps wounded their arms, yet did not stop them. The captain
               shouted not to fire, but he was not listened to. The islanders seeing that the shots
               of our guns did them little or no harm would not retire, but shouted more loudly, and
               springing from one side to the other to avoid our shots, they at the same time drew
               nearer to us, throwing arrows, javelins, spears hardened in fire, stones, and even
               mud, so that we could hardly defend ourselves. Some of them cast lances pointed with
               iron at the captain-general.</p>
            <p>He then, in order to disperse this multitude and to terrify them, sent some of our
               men to set fire to their houses, but this rendered them more ferocious. Some of them
               ran to the fire, which consumed twenty or thirty houses, and there killed two of our
               men. The rest came down upon us with greater fury; they perceived that our bodies
               were defended, but that the legs were exposed, and they aimed at them principally.
               The captain had his right leg pierced by a poisoned arrow, on which account he gave
               orders to retreat by degrees; but almost all our men took to precipitate flight, so
               that there remained hardly six or eight of us with him. We were oppressed by the
               lances and stones which the enemy hurled at us, and we could make no more resistance.
               The bombards which we had in the boats were of no assistance to us, for the shoal
               water kept them too far from the beach. We went thither, retreating little by little,
               and still fighting, and we had already got to the distance of a crossbow shot from
               the shore, having the water up to our knees, the islanders following and picking up
               again the spears which they had already cast, and they threw the same spear five or
               six times; as they knew the captain they aimed specially at him, and twice they
               knocked the helmet off his head. He, with a few of us, like a good knight, remained
               at his post without choosing to retreat further. Thus we fought for more than an
               hour, until an Indian succeeded in thrusting a cane lance into the captain's face. He
               then, being irritated, pierced the Indian's breast with his lance, and left it in his
               body, and trying to draw his sword he was unable to draw it more than half way, on
               account of a javelin wound which he had received in the right arm. The enemies seeing
               this all rushed against him, and one of them with a great sword, like a great
               scimetar gave him a great blow on the left leg, which brought the captain down on his
               face, then the <span class="ethnicGroup">Indians</span> threw themselves upon him,
               and ran him through with lances and scimetars, and all the other arms which they had,
               so that they deprived of life our mirror, light, comfort, and true guide. Whilst the
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Indians</span> were thus overpowering him, several times
               he turned round towards us to see if we were all in safety, as though his obstinate
               fight had no other object than to give an opportunity for the retreat of his men. We
               who fought to extremity, and who were covered with wounds, seeing that he was dead,
               proceeded to the boats which were on the point of going away. This fatal battle was
               fought on the <span class="date">27th of April of 1521,</span> on a Saturday; a day
               which the captain had chosen himself, because he had a special devotion to it. There
               perished with him eight of our men, and four of the <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Indians</span>, who had become <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>; we
               had also many wounded, amongst whom I must reckon myself. The enemy lost only fifteen
               men.</p>
            <p>He died; but I hope that your illustrious highness will not allow his memory to be
               lost, so much the more since I see revived in you the virtue of so great a captain,
               since one of his principal virtues was constance in the most adverse fortune. In the
               midst of the sea he was able to endure hunger better than we. Most versed in nautical
               charts, he knew better than any other the true art of navigation, of which it is a
               certain proof that he knew by his genius, and his intrepidity, without any one having
               given him the example, how to attempt the circuit of the globe, which he had almost
               completed.</p>
            <p>The Christian king could indeed have given us aid, and would have done so; but our
               captain far from forseeing that which happened, when he landed with his men, had
               charged him not to come out of his balangai, wishing that he should stay there to see
               how we fought. When he knew how the captain had died he wept bitterly for him.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon the king himself with our consent, sent to tell the inhabitants of
                  <span class="placeName">Matan</span>, that if they would give up to us the body of
               our captain, and of our other companions who were killed in this battle, we would
               give them as much merchandise as they might wish for; but they answered that on no
               account would they ever give up that man, but they wished to preserve him as a
               monument of their triumph. When the death of the captain was known, those who were in
               the city to trade, had all the merchandise at once transported to the ships. We then
               elected in the place of the captain, Duarte Barbosa, a <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Portuguese</span>, and a relation of the captain's, and <span class="persName"
                  >Juan Serrano a Spaniard</span>.</p>
            <p>Our interpreter, who was a slave of the captain-general, and was named Henry, having
               been slightly wounded in the battle, would not go ashore any more for the things
               which we required, but remained all day idle, and wrapped up in his mat (Schiavina).
               Duarte Barbosa, the commander of the flag ship, found fault with him, and told him
               that though his master was dead, he had not become free on that account, but that
               when we returned to <span class="placeName">Spain</span> he would return him to Doña
               Beatrice, the widow of the captain-general; at the same time he threatened to have
               him flogged, if he did not go on shore quickly, and do what was wanted for the
               service of the ships. The slave rose up, and did as though he did not care much for
               these affronts and threats; and having gone on shore, he informed the Christian king
               that we were thinking of going away soon, but that if he would follow his advice, he
               might become master of all our goods and of the ships themselves. The King of <span
                  class="placeName">Zubu</span> listened favourably to him, and they arranged to
               betray us. After that the slave returned on board, and showed more intelligence and
               attention than he had done before.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Wednesday morning, the 1st of May</span>, the Christian king sent
               to tell the two commanders that the jewels prepared as presents for the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span> were ready, and he invited them to come that same
               day to dine with him, with some of his most honoured companions, and he would give
               them over to them. The commanders went with twenty-four others, and amongst them was
               our astrologer named San Martin of <span class="placeName">Seville</span>. I could
               not go because I was swelled with a wound from a poisoned arrow in the forehead. Juan
               Carvalho, with the chief of police, who also were invited, turned back, and said that
               they had suspected some bad business, because they had seen the man who had recovered
               from illness by a miracle, leading away the priest to his own house. They had hardly
               spoken these words when we heard great lamentations and cries. We quickly got up the
               anchors and, coming closer to the beach, we fired several shots with the cannon at
               the houses. There then appeared on the beach <span class="persName">Juan
                  Serrano</span>, in his shirt, wounded and bound, who entreated us, as loudly as he
               could, not to fire any more, or else he would be massacred. We asked him what had
               become of his companions and the interpreter, and he said that all had been slain
               except the interpreter. He then entreated us to ransom him with some merchandise; but
               Juan Carvalho, although he was his gossip, joined with some others, refused to do it,
               and they would not allow any boat to go ashore, so that they might remain masters of
               the ships. <span class="persName">Serrano</span> continued his entreaties and
               lamentations, saying, that if we departed and abandoned him there, he would soon be
               killed; and after that he saw his lamentations were useless, he added that be prayed
               God to ask for an account of his life at the day of Judgment from Juan Carvalho, his
               gossip. Notwithstanding, we sailed immediately; and I never heard any more news of
               him.</p>
            <p>In this island of <span class="placeName">Zubu</span> there are dogs and cats, and
               other animals, whose flesh is eaten; there is also rice, millet, panicum, and maize;
               there are also figs, oranges, lemons, sugar-canes, cocos, gourds, ginger, honey, and
               other such things; they also make palm-wine of many qualities. Gold is abundant. The
               island is large, and has a good port with two entrances: one to the west, and the
               other to the east-north-east. It is in ten degrees north latitude and 154 east
               longitude from the line of demarcation. </p>
            <p>In this island there are several towns, each of which has its principal men or
               chiefs. Here are the names of the towns and their chiefs:— </p>
            <p>Cingapola: its chiefs are <span class="persName">Cilaton</span>, <span
                  class="persName">Ciguibucan</span>, <span class="persName">Cimaninga</span>, <span
                  class="persName">Cimaticat</span>, <span class="persName">Cicanbul</span>.</p>
            <p>Mandani: its chief is <span class="persName">Aponoaan</span>.</p>
            <p>Lalan: its chief is <span class="persName">Teten</span>.</p>
            <p>Lalutan: its chief is <span class="persName">Japau</span>.</p>
            <p>Lubucin: its chief is <span class="persName">Cilumai</span>.</p>
            <p>All these countries were in obedience to us, and paid a kind of tribute.</p>
            <p>Near to <span class="placeName">Zubu</span> there is, as we said, the island of <span
                  class="placeName">Matan</span>, the most considerable town of which is called
                  <span class="placeName">Matan</span>, and its chiefs are <span class="persName"
                  >Zula</span> and <span class="persName">Cilapulapu</span>. The village, which we
               burned on the occasion of the fatal battle, is named <span class="placeName"
                  >Bulaia</span>.</p>
            <p>In this island, before we lost our captain-general, we had news of <span
                  class="placeName">Maluco</span>.</p> (Book III of the Milan Edition.) Departure
            from <span class="placeName">Zubu</span>. <p>When we were at a distance of eighteen
               leagues from the island of <span class="placeName">Zubu</span>, near the head of
               another island called Bohol, in the midst of that archipelago, seeing that our crews
               were too much reduced in number, so that they were not sufficient for managing all
               the three ships, we burned the Conception after transporting into the other two all
               that it contained that was servicable. We then took the S. S.W.course, coasting along
               an island called Panilongon, where the people were black as in Ethiopia.</p>
            <p>We then arrived at a large island, the king of which having come on board our ship,
               in order to show that he made alliance with us and would be friendly, drew blood from
               his left hand, and stained with it his breast, his face, and the tip of his tongue.
               We then did likewise, and when the king went away, I alone accompanied him on shore
               to see the island.</p>
            <p>We entered a river where we met many fishermen, who presented some of their fish to
               the king. He then took off the cloth which covered his middle, and some of his chief
               men who were with him did the same, they then all began to row and to sing. Passing
               near many houses, which were on the brink of the river, we arrived at two hours of
               the night at the house of the king, which was two leagues from the mouth of the river
               where the ships were.</p>
            <p>When we reached the house, people came to meet us with many torches, made of canes
               and palm leaves, full of the before-mentioned gum, called anime. Whilst supper was
               being got ready, the king, with two of his chiefs, and two rather handsome ladies,
               drank a large vase full of palm wine, without eating anything. I, excusing myself
               saying that I had already supped, only drank once. In drinking they use the ceremony
               which I have already described in speaking of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Massava</span>. Then the supper was brought, which consisted of rice and fish,
               very much salted, in porcelain dishes. Rice with them takes the place of bread. They
               cook it in the following manner, which is common to all these countries. They place
               inside an earthen pot like ours, a large leaf which lines it all round internally,
               then they put in the water and the rice, and cover up the pot. They let it boil until
               the rice has taken the consistency of bread, and then they take it out in pieces.</p>
            <p>When the supper was over the king had brought a cane mat, and a mat of palm leaf,
               with a cushion of leaves, and this was to be my bed. I slept there with one of his
               chiefs. The king with the two ladies went to sleep in another place.</p>
            <p>When it was day, whilst breakfast was being prepared, I went to take a turn in the
               island, and entered several houses, constructed like those of the neighbouring
               islands; I saw there a good many utensils of gold, but very little victuals. I
               returned to the king's house, and we breakfasted with rice and fish. I succeeded in
               making the king understand by signs, that I should like to see the queen; and he made
               a sign to me that he was content, and we set out together to the top of a hill, under
               which her house was placed. I entered the house and made her an obeisance, she did
               likewise to me. I sat down by the side of her; she was weaving a palm mat to sleep
               upon. Throughout her house were seen porcelain vases suspended to the walls, and four
               metal timbals, of which one was very large, another of middle size, and two small
               ones, and she amused herself by playing on them. There were many male and female
               slaves for her service. We asked leave and returned to the king's house, who
               immediately ordered a refreshment of sugar canes.</p>
            <p>After midday, as I wished to return to the ships, the king, with the other chief men
               of the island, desired to accompany me in the same balangai, going by the same river;
               on its right bank I saw on an eminence three men hanging to a tree, the branches of
               which had been cut off. I asked of the king what those unhappy people were, he
               answered me that they were malefactors and thieves. These people go naked like their
               neighbours. In this island are found pigs, goats, fowls, rice, ginger, and other
               things which were common to the islands named before. That which is most abundant is
               gold. They showed me certain valleys, making signs that there was more gold there
               than hairs on the head, but that as they had not iron to dig it out, it required
               great labour to acquire it, and which they did not choose to undergo. The king is
               named <span class="persName">Raja Calanao</span>.</p>
            <p>This part of the island called <span class="placeName">Chipit</span> is the same land
               as Butuan<span class="placeName"></span> and <span class="placeName">Calagan</span>,
               it passes above <span class="placeName">Bohol</span>, and borders on <span
                  class="placeName">Massava</span>. Its port is good enough; it is in 8° N.latitude,
               and 167° of longitude from the line of demarcation; it is fifty leagues distance from
                  <span class="placeName">Zubu</span>. Towards the North-west is the island of <span
                  class="placeName">Lozon</span>, which is at two days' distance; a large island, to
               which come to trade every year six or eight junks of the people called Lequii.</p>
            <p>On leaving this place, and taking our course between west and south-west, we touched
               at an almost uninhabited island, which afterwards we learned was named <span
                  class="placeName">Cagayan</span>. The few people there are <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span>, who have been banished from an island called
                  <span class="placeName">Burné.</span> They go naked like the others, and carry
               blow-pipes with small quivers at their sides full of arrows, and a herb with which
               they poison them. They have daggers, with hilts adorned with gold and precious
               stones, lances, bucklers, and small cuirasses of buffaloes' hide. These people took
               us for something Divine or holy. There are some very large trees in this island, but
               little victuals. It is in 7° 30' North latitude, and forty-three leagues from <span
                  class="placeName">Chipit</span>.</p>
            <p>Continuing our voyage we changed our course to between West and North-west, and after
               running twenty-five leagues, we arrived at a large island, which we found well
               provided with victuals, and it was great good fortune for us since we were so reduced
               by hunger and so badly supplied, that we were several times on the point of
               abandoning the ships, and establishing ourselves on some land, in order to live. In
               this island, which we learned was named <span class="placeName">Palaoan</span>, we
               found pigs, goats, fowls, yams, bananas of various kinds, some of which are half a
               cubit long, and as thick as the arm, others are only a span long, and others are
               still smaller, and these are the best; they have cocoa nuts, sugar canes, and certain
               roots like turnips. They cook rice under the fire in bamboo canes, or wooden vessels,
               and it keeps longer than that cooked in earthen pots. They draw from the rice with a
               kind of alembic a wine that is better and stronger than the palm wine. In short we
               found this island to be a promised land.</p>
            <p>We presented ourselves to the king, who contracted alliance and friendship with us,
               and to assure us of it, he asked for one of our knives, with which he drew blood from
               his breast, with which he touched his forehead and tongue. We repeated the same
               ceremony.</p>
            <p>The people of <span class="placeName">Palaoan</span> go naked like the other
               islanders, they almost all till their own fields. They have blow-pipes, with thick
               arrows more than a span in length, with a point like that of a harpoon; some have a
               point made with a fish bone, and others are of reed, poisoned with a certain herb;
               the arrows are not trimmed with feathers, but with a soft light wood. At the foot of
               the blow-pipe they bind a piece of iron, by means of which, when they have no more
               arrows, they wield the blow-pipe like a lance. They like to adorn themselves with
               rings and chains of gimp and with little bells, but above all they are fond of brass
               wire, with which they bind their fish hooks. They have some rather large domestic
               cocks, which, from some superstition, they do not eat, but they keep them for
               fighting; on such occasions they make bets and offer prizes, which are acquired by
               the owner of the conquering cock.</p>
            <p>Going from <span class="placeName">Palaoan</span> towards the South-west, after a run
               of ten leagues, we reached another island. Whilst coasting it, it seemed in a certain
               manner to go forward;we coasted it for a distance of fully fifty leagues, until we
               found a port. We had hardly reached the port when the heavens were darkened, and the
               lights of St. Elmo appeared on our masts.</p>
            <p>The next day the king of that island sent a prahu to the ships; it was very handsome,
               with its prow and stern ornamented with gold; on the bow fluttered a white and blue
               flag, with a tuft of peacock's feathers at the top of the staff; there were in the
               prahu some people playing on pipes and drums, and many other persons. Two almadias
               followed the prahu; these are fishermen's boats, and a prahu is a kind of fusta.
               Eight old men of the chiefs of the island came into the ships, and sat down upon a
               carpet on the poop, and presented a painted wooden vase full of betel and areca
               (fruits which they constantly chew), with orange and jessamine flowers, and covered
               over with a cloth of yellow silk. They also gave two cages full of fowls, two goats,
               three vessels full of wine, distilled from rice, and some bundles of sugar cane. They
               did the same to the other ship; and embracing us they departed. Their rice wine is
               clear like water, but so strong that many of our men were intoxicated. They call it
               arak.</p>
            <p>Six days later the king again sent three very ornamented prahus, which came playing
               pipes and drums and cymbals, and going round the ships, their crews saluted us with
               their cloth caps, which hardly cover the tops of their heads. We saluted them, firing
               the bombards without stones. Then they made us a present of various victuals, but all
               made with rice, either wrapped in leaves in the form of a long cylinder, or in the
               shape of a sugar loaf, or in the shape of a cake, with eggs and honey. They then said
               that their king was well pleased that we should make provisions here of wood and
               water, and that we might traffic at our pleasure with the islanders. Having heard
               this, seven of us entered one of the prahus, taking with us presents for the king,
               and for some of his court. The present intended for the king consisted in a <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Turkish</span> coat of green velvet, a chair of violet
               coloured velvet, five ells of red cloth, a cap, a gilt goblet, and a vase of glass,
               with its cover, three packets of paper, and a gilt pen and ink case. We took for the
               queen three ells of yellow cloth, a pair of slippers, ornamented with silver, and a
               silver case full of pins. For the king's governor or minister three ells of red
               cloth, a cap, and a gilt goblet; and for the herald who had come in the prahu, a coat
               of the <span class="ethnicGroup">Turkish</span> fashion, of red and green colours, a
               cap and a packet of paper, for the other seven chief men who had come with him, we
               prepared presents; for one cloth, for another a cap, and for each a packet of paper.
               Having made these preparations, we entered the prahu, and departed.</p>
            <p>When we arrived at the city, we were obliged to wait about two hours in the prahu,
               until there came thither two elephants covered with silk, and twelve men, each of
               whom carried a porcelain vase covered with silk, for conveying and wrapping up our
               presents. We mounted the elephants, and those twelve men preceded us, carrying the
               vases with our presents. We went as far as the house of the governor, who gave us
               supper with many sorts of viands. There we slept through the night, on mattresses
               filled with cotton, and covered with silk, with sheets of Cambay stuff. On the
               following day we remained doing nothing in the house till midday, and after that we
               set out for the king's palace. We were again mounted upon the elephants, and the men
               with the presents preceded us as before. From the governor's house to that of the
               king, all the streets were full of men armed with swords, spears, and bucklers, the
               king having so commanded. We entered the palace still mounted upon the elephants; we
               then dismounted, and ascended a staircase, accompanied by the governor and some of
               the chief men, and entered a large room full of courtiers, whom we should call the
               barons of the kingdom; there we sat upon a carpet, and the vases with the presents
               were placed near us.</p>
            <p>At the end of this hall there was another a little higher, but not so large, all hung
               with silk stuffs, among which were two curtains of brocade hung up, and leaving open
               two windows which gave light to the room.</p>
            <p>There were placed three hundred men of the king's guard with naked daggers in their
               hands, which they held on their thighs. At the end of this second hall was a great
               opening, covered with a curtain of brocade, and on this being raised we saw the king
               sitting at a table, with a little child of his, chewing betel. Behind him there were
               only women.</p>
            <p>Then one of the chief men informed us that we could not speak to the king, but that
               if we wished to convey anything to him, we were to say it to him, and he would say it
               to a chief or courtier of higher rank, who would lay it before a brother of the
               governor, who was in the smaller room, and they by means of a blow pipe placed in a
               fissure in the wall would communicate our thoughts to a man who was near the king,
               and from him the king would understand them. He taught us meanwhile to make three
               obeisances to the king, with the hands joined above the head, raising first one then
               the other foot, and then to kiss the hands to him. This is the royal obeisance. Then
               by the mode which had been indicated to us, we gave him to understand that we
               belonged to the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, who wished to be in
               peace with him, and wished for nothing else than to be able to trade with his island.
               The king caused an answer to be given that he was most pleased that the king of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span> was his friend, and that we could take wood and
               water in his states, and traffic according to our pleasure. That done we offered the
               presents, and at each thing which they gave to him, he made a slight inclination with
               his head. To each of us was then given some brocade, with cloth of gold, and some
               silk, which they placed upon one of our shoulders, and then took away to take care of
               them. A collation of cloves and cinnamon was then served to us, and after that the
               curtains were drawn and the windows closed. All the men who were in the palace had
               their middles covered with cloth of gold and silk, they carried in their hands
               daggers with gold hilts, adorned with pearls and precious stones, and they had many
               rings on their fingers.</p>
            <p>We again mounted the elephants, and returned to the house of the governor. Seven men
               preceded us there, carrying the presents made to us, and when we reached the house
               they gave to each one of us what was for him, putting it on our left shoulder, as had
               been done in the king's palace. To each of these seven men we gave a pair of knives
               in recompense for their trouble.</p>
            <p>Afterwards there came nine men to the governor's house, sent by the king, with as
               many large wooden trays, in each of which were ten or twelve china dishes, with the
               flesh of various animals, such as veal, capons, fowls, peacocks, and others, with
               various sorts of fish, so that only of flesh there were thirty or thirty-two
               different viands. We supped on the ground on a palm mat; at each mouthful we drank a
               little china cup of the size of an egg full of the distilled liquor of rice: we then
               ate some rice and some things made of sugar, using gold spoons made like ours. In the
               place in which we passed the two nights there were two candles of white wax always
               burning, placed on high chandeliers of silver, and two oil lamps with four wicks
               each. Two men kept watch there to take care of them. The next morning we came upon
               the same elephants to the sea shore, where there were two prahus ready, in which we
               were taken back to the ships.</p>
            <p>This city is entirely built on foundations in the salt water, except the houses of
               the king and some of the princes: it contains twenty-five thousand fires or families.
               The houses are all of wood, placed on great piles to raise them high up. When the
               tide rises the women go in boats through the city selling provisions and necessaries.
               In front of the king's house there is a wall made of great bricks, with barbicans
               like forts, upon which were fifty-six bombards of metal, and six of iron. They fired
               many shots from them during the two days that we passed in the city.</p>
            <p>The king to whom we presented ourselves is a Moor, and is named <span
                  class="persName">Raja Siripada</span>: he is about forty years of age, and is
               rather corpulent. No one serves him except ladies who are the daughters of the
               chiefs. No one speaks to him except by means of the blow-pipe as has been described
               above. He has ten scribes, who write down his affairs on thin bark of trees, and are
               called chiritoles. He never goes out of his house except to go hunting.</p>
            <p><span class="date">On Monday, the 29th of July</span>, we saw coming towards us more
               than a hundred prahus, divided into three squadrons, and as many tungulis, which are
               their smaller kind of boats. At this sight, and fearing treachery, we hurriedly set
               sail, and left behind an anchor in the sea. Our suspicions increased when we observed
               that behind us were certain junks which had come the day before. Our first operation
               was to free ourselves from the junks, against which we fired, capturing four and
               killing many people: three or four other junks went aground in escaping. In one of
               those which we captured was a son of the king of the isle of <span class="placeName"
                  >Luzon</span>, who was captain-general of the King of Burné, and who was coming
               with the junks from the conquest of a great city named <span class="placeName"
                  >Laoe</span>, situated on a headland of this island opposite <span
                  class="placeName">Java</span> Major. He had made this expedition and sacked that
               city because its inhabitants wished rather to obey the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Java</span> than the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moorish</span>
               King of Burné. The <span class="ethnicGroup">Moorish</span> king having heard of the
               ill-treatment by us of his junks, hastened to send to say, by means of one of our men
               who was on shore to traffic, that those vessels had not come to do any harm to us,
               but were going to make war against the <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, in
               proof of which they showed us some of the heads of those they had slain.</p>
            <p>Hearing this, we sent to tell the king that if it was so, that he should allow two of
               our men who were still on shore, with a son of our pilot, Juan Carvalho, to come to
               the ships: this son of Carvalho's had been born during his first residence in the
               country of Brazil: but the king would not consent. Juan Carvalho was thus specially
               punished, for without communicating the matter to us, in order to obtain a large sum
               of gold, as we learned later, he had given his liberty to the captain of the junks.
               If he had detained him, the King Siripada would have given anything to get him back,
               that captain being exceedingly dreaded by the <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Gentiles</span> who are most hostile to the <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Moorish</span> king.</p>
            <p>And, with respect to that, it is well to know and understand that in that same port
               where we were, beyond the city of the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> of which
               I have spoken, there is another inhabited by <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Gentiles</span>, larger than this one, and also built in the salt water. So great
               is the enmity between the two nations that every day there occurs strife. The king of
               the <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span> is as powerful as the king of the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span>, but he is not so proud; and it seems that it
               would not be so difficult to introduce the Christian religion into his country.</p>
            <p>As we could not get back our men, we retained on board sixteen of the chiefs, and
               three ladies whom we had taken on board the junks, to take them to <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>, We had destined the ladies for the Queen; but Juan
               Carvalho kept them for himself.</p>
            <p>The <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> of <span class="placeName">Burné</span> go
               naked like the other islanders. They esteem quicksilver very much, and swallow it.
               They pretend that it preserves the health of those who are well, and that it cures
               the sick. They venerate Mahomed and follow his law. They do not eat pig's flesh. With
               their right hand they wash their face, but do not wash their teeth with their
               fingers. They are circumcised like the<span class="ethnicGroup"> Jews.</span> They
               never kill goats or fowls without first speaking to the sun. They cut off the ends of
               the wings of fowls and the skin under their feet, and then split them in two. They do
               not eat any animal which has not been killed by themselves.</p>
            <p>In this island is produced camphor, a kind of balsam which exudes from between the
               bark and the wood of the tree. These drops are small as grains of bran. If it is left
               exposed by degrees it is consumed: here it is called capor. Here is found also
               cinnamon, ginger, mirabolans, oranges, lemons, sugarcanes, melons, gourds, cucumbers,
               cabbage, onions. There are also many animals, such as elephants, horses, buffaloes,
               pigs, goats, fowls, geese, crows, and others.</p>
            <p>They say that the King of <span class="placeName">Burné</span> has two pearls as
               large as a hen's eggs, and so perfectly round that if placed on a smooth table they
               cannot be made to stand still. When we took him the presents I made signs to him that
               I desired to see them, and he said that he would show them to me, but he did not do
               so. On the following day some of the chief men told me that they had indeed seen
               them.</p>
            <p>The money which the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> use in this country is of
               metal, and pierced for stringing together. On one side only it has four signs, which
               are four letters of the great King of <span class="placeName">China</span>: they call
               it Picis. For one cathil (a weight equal to two of our pounds) of quicksilver they
               gave us six porcelain dishes, for a cathil of metal they gave one small porcelain
               vase, and a large vase for three knives. For a hand of paper they gave one hundred
               picis. A bahar of wax (which is two hundred and three cathils) for one hundred and
               sixty cathils of bronze: for eighty cathils a bahar of salt: for forty cathils a
               bahar of anime, a gum which they use to caulk ships, for in these countries they have
               no pitch. Twenty tabil make a cathil. The merchandise which is most esteemed here is
               bronze, quicksilver, cinnabar, glass, woollen stuffs, linens; but above all they
               esteem iron and spectacles.</p>
            <p>Since I saw such use made of porcelain, I got some information respecting it, and I
               learned that it is made with a kind of very white earth, which is left underground
               for fully fifty years to refine it, so that they are in the habit of saying that the
               father buries it for his son. It is said that if poison is put into a vessel of fine
               porcelain it breaks immediately.</p>
            <p>The junks mentioned several times above are their largest vessels, and they are
               constructed in this manner. The lower part of the ships and the sides to a height of
               two spans above water-line are built of planks joined together with wooden bolts, and
               they are well enough put together. The upper works are made of very large canes for a
               counterpoise. One of these junks carries as much cargo as our ships. The masts are of
               bamboo, and the sails of bark of trees. This island is so large that to sail round it
               with a prahu would require three months. It is in 5° 15' north latitude and 176° 40'
               of longitude from the line of demarcation.</p>
            <p>On leaving this island we returned backwards to look for a convenient place for
               caulking our ships, which were leaking, and one of them, through the negligence of
               the pilot, struck on a shoal near an island named Bibalon; but, by the help of God,
               we got her off. We also ran another great danger, for a sailor, in snuffing a candle,
               threw the lighted wick into a chest of gunpowder; but he was so quick in picking it
               out that the powder did not catch fire.</p>
            <p>On our way we saw four prahus. We took one laden with cocoanuts on its way to Burné;
               but the crew escaped to a small island, and the other three prahus escaped behind
               some other small islands. </p>
            <p>Between the northern cape of <span class="placeName">Burné</span>; and the island
               named <span class="placeName">Cimbonbon</span>, situated in 8° 7' N. latitude there
               is a very convenient port for refitting ships, and we entered it; but as we were
               wanting many things necessary for our work, we had to spend there forty-two days.
               Each one worked at one thing or another according to the best of his knowledge or
               ability; but our greatest labour was going to get wood in the thickets, as the ground
               was covered with briars and thorny shrubs, and we had no shoes. </p>
            <p>In this island there are some very large wild boars. Whilst we were in a boat we
               killed one which was crossing from one island to another. Its head was two and a half
               spans long, and its tusks were exceedingly long. Here also are crocodiles; those of
               the land are larger than those of the sea-coast. There are oysters and very large
               turtles; of these we caught two. The flesh alone of one of them weighed twenty
               pounds, and of the other forty-four pounds. We caught a kind of fish with a head like
               that of a pig, and which had two horns; its body was all covered with bone, and on
               its back it had a kind of saddle: this was a small one. In this island are also found
               certain trees, the leaves of which, when they fall, are animated, and walk. They are
               like the leaves of the mulberry tree, but not so long; they have the leaf stalk short
               and pointed, and near the leaf stalk they have on each side two feet. If they are
               touched they escape, but if crushed they do not give out blood. I kept one for nine
               days in a box. When I opened it the leaf went round the box. I believe they live upon
               air. The island in which we were is called <span class="placeName"
               >Pulaoan</span>.</p>
            <p>On leaving this island—that is to say, the port which is at the extremity of it—we
               met a junk which was coming from Borneo. We made signals to it to strike its sails;
               but as it would not obey we overtook it, captured and pillaged it. It had on board
               the Governor of <span class="placeName">Pulaoan</span>, with a son and a brother of
               his. We made them all prisoners, and put them to ransom to give within seven days
               four hundred measures of rice, twenty pigs, as many goats, and four hundred and fifty
               fowls. They caused all this to be given us, and besides added spontaneously
               cocoanuts, figs, sugarcanes, and vessels full of palm wine. We, in consequence of his
               generosity, restored to him some of his daggers and arquebuses; we also gave him a
               flag, a garment of yellow damask, and fifteen ells of linen. We gave to his son a
               cloak of blue cloth, and to his brother a garment of green cloth, and to the others
               other things, and we parted good friends.</p>
            <p>We turned backwards, passing between the island of <span class="placeName"
                  >Cagayan</span> and the port of Cipit, taking a course east and a quarter
               south-east, to seek the islands of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>. We passed
               between certain little mountains, around which we found many weeds, although there
               was there a great depth. Passing between these islets it seemed that we were in
               another sea.</p>
            <p>Having left <span class="placeName">Cipit</span> to the east, we saw to the west two
               islands called <span class="placeName">Zolo</span> and Taghima, near which islands
               pearls are found. The two pearls of the King of Burné, of which I have spoken, were
               found there, and this is the manner in which he obtained them, according to the
               account which was given me of it. The King of Burné married a daughter of the King of
                  <span class="placeName">Zolo</span>, who told him that her father had these two
               big pearls. He desired to have them, and decided on getting them by any means, and
               one night he set out with five hundred prahus full of armed men, and went to <span
                  class="placeName">Zolo</span>, and took the king with his two sons, and brought
               them to Burné, and did not restore them to liberty until they gave him the two
               pearls.</p>
            <p>Continuing our course east and a quarter north-east we passed near two inhabited
               places called <span class="placeName">Cavit</span> and Subanin, and passed near an
               island called Monoripa, ten leagues distant from the before-mentioned islets. The
               inhabitants of this island always live in their vessels, and have no houses on shore.
               In these two districts of <span class="placeName">Cavit</span> and Subanin, which are
               situated in the same island as that in which are Butuan and Calagan, the best
               cinnamon of any grows. If we could have remained here only two days, we could have
               laden the ships with it; but we did not wish to lose time, but to profit by the
               favourable wind, for we had to double a cape and some islets which were around it.
               Wherefore, remaining under sail, we made a little barter, and obtained seventeen
               pounds of cinnamon for two big knives, which we had taken from the Governor of <span
                  class="placeName">Pulaoan</span>.</p>
            <p>Having seen the cinnamon tree, I can give some description of it. It is a small tree,
               not more than three or four cubits high, and of the thickness of a man's finger, and
               it has not got more than three or four little branches. Its leaf is like that of the
               laurel. The cinnamon for use which comes to us, is its bark, which is gathered twice
               in the year. Its wood and leaves when they are green have the taste and force of the
               bark itself. Here it is called <span class="placeName">Cainmana</span>, since cain
               means wood and mana sweet.</p>
            <p>Having set the head of the ship to north-east, we made for a large city called<span
                  class="persName"> Maingdanao</span>, situated in the same island in which are
               Butuan and Calagan, in order to get precise information of the position of <span
                  class="placeName">Maluco</span>. Following this course we took possession of a
               bignaday, a vessel similar to a prahu, and being obliged to have recourse to force
               and violence, we killed seven out of eighteen men who formed the crew. These men were
               better made and more robust than all those we had seen hitherto, and they were all
               chief men of Mindanao. There was among them a brother of the king who said that he
               well knew where <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> was. Afterwards, following his
               indications, we left the north-east course which we held, and took a south-east
               course. We were then in 6° 7' N. latitude and thirty leagues distant fom <span
                  class="placeName">Cavit</span>.</p>
            <p>We were told that at a cape of this island near to a river there are men who are
               rather hairy, great warriors, and good archers, armed with swords a span broad. When
               they make an enemy prisoner they eat his heart only, and they eat it raw with the
               juice of oranges or lemons. This cape is called Benaian.</p>
            <p>Making for the south-east we found four islands, named <span class="placeName"
                  >Ciboco</span>, <span class="placeName">Birabam Batolac</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Sarangani</span>, and <span class="placeName">Candigar</span>.
                  <span class="date">Saturday, the 26th of October</span>, about nightfall, whilst
               coasting the island of Birabam Batolac, we met with a very great storm, before which
               we lowered all our sails, and betook ourselves to prayer. Then our three saints
               appeared upon the masts and dispersed the darkness. St. Elmo stood for more than two
               hours at the mainmast head like a flame. St. Nicholas at the head of the foremast,
               and St. Clara on the mizenmast. In gratitude for their assistance we promised a share
               to each of the saints, and we gave to each an offering.</p>
            <p>Continuing our voyage we entered a port between the two islands <span
                  class="placeName">Sarangani</span> and <span class="placeName">Candigar</span>,
               and cast anchor to the east, near a village of Sarangani, where pearls and gold are
               found. This port is in 5° 9' N.latitude, and fifty leagues from <span
                  class="placeName">Cavit</span>. The inhabitants are <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Gentiles</span> and go naked like the others.</p>
            <p>Having remained here a day we compelled by force two pilots to come with us to show
               us the way to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>. We were directed to take a
               south-south-west course, and passed between eight islands partly inhabited, partly
               uninhabited, which formed a kind of street. These were named Cheava, Caviao, Cabiao
               Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan, and Nuza. At the end of these we reached an island
               which was very beautiful, named Sanghir. But having a contrary wind, which did not
               allow us to double the cape, we tacked about backwards and forwards near it.</p>
            <p>On this occasion, profiting by the darkness of the night, one of the pilots whom we
               had caught at Sarangani, and with him the brother of the king of Mindanao with his
               little son, escaped by swimming and reached that island; but we learned later that
               the son not being able to hold on well to his father's shoulders, was drowned.</p>
            <p>Seeing that it was impossible to double the head of this island we passed below it,
               where we saw many small islands. This large island has four kings whose names are
               Raja <span class="placeName">Matan</span>datu, Raja Laga, Raja Bapti, and Raja
               Parabu. These are <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>. It is in 3° 30'
               N.latitude and twenty-seven leagues from Sarangani.</p>
            <p>Continuing our course in the same direction we passed near five islands named Cheoma,
               Carachita, Para, Zangalura, and Cian. This last is ten leagues distant from Sanghir.
               In this island there is a rather high mountain, but not one of great extent. Its king
               is named Raja Ponto. We came next to the island <span class="placeName"
                  >Paghinzara</span>, which has three high mountains, and in it the king is Raja
               Babintan. We saw at twelve leagues to the east of Paghinzara another island, Talant,
               and also two islands, not large but inhabited, called Zoar and Mean.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Wednesday, the 6th of November</span>, having passed beyond these
               two islands, we discovered four other rather high islands at a distance of fourteen
               leagues towards the east. The pilot who had remained with us told us those were the
                  <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> islands, for which we gave thanks to God,
               and to comfort ourselves we discharged all our artillery. It need not cause wonder
               that we were so much rejoiced, since we had passed twenty-seven months less two days
               always in search of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>, wandering for that object
               among the immense number of islands. But I must say that near all these islands the
               least depth that we found was one hundred fathoms, for which reason attention is not
               to be given to all that the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> have spread,
               according to whom the islands of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> are situated
               in seas which cannot be navigated on account of the shoals, and the dark and foggy
               atmosphere.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Friday, the 8th November of 1521</span>, three hours before
               sunset, we entered a port of the island called <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>,
               and having gone near the shore, we cast anchor in twenty fathoms, and discharged all
               our artillery. Next day the king came to the ships in a prahu, and went round them.
               We went to meet him with a boat to show him honour, and he made us enter his prahu,
               and sit near him. He was sitting under a silk umbrella, which sheltered him. In front
               of him was his son with the royal sceptre, there were also two men with gold vases to
               give him water for his hands, and two others with gilt caskets full of betel.</p>
            <p>The king gave us a welcome, and said that a long time back he had dreamed that some
               ships were coming to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> from distant countries,
               and that to assure himself with respect to this, he had examined the moon, and he had
               seen that they were really coming, and that indeed they were our ships. After that he
               came on board our ships, and we all kissed his hand: we then conducted him to the
               poop, but he, in order to avoid stooping, would not enter the cabin except by the
               upper opening. We made him sit down on a chair of red velvet, and placed on him a
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Turkish</span> robe of yellow velvet. In order to do him
               more honour we sat down before him on the ground. When he had heard who we were, and
               what was the object of our voyage, he said that he and all his people were well
               content to be the most faithful friends and vassals of the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>; that he received us in this island as his own
               sons; that we might go on shore and remain there as in our own houses; and that his
               island for the future should not be named <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, but
                  <span class="placeName">Castile</span>, in proof of the great love he bore to the
               king our master. Then we presented to him the chair on which he sat, and the robe
               which we had put on him, a piece of fine linen, four ells of scarlet cloth, a robe of
               brocade, a cloth of yellow damask, a piece of the whitest Cambay linen, two caps, six
               strings of glass beads, twelve knives, three large mirrors, six scissors, six combs,
               some gilt goblets, and other things. We gave to his son an Indian cloth of gold and
               silk, a large mirror, a cap and two knives. To each of the nine chief men of his
               suite we made a present of a piece of silk, a cap and two knives; and to many others
               of his suite we made a present, to one of a cap, to another of a knife, until the
               king told us not to give any more presents. He then said that he had got nothing
               worthy to be sent as a present to our king, unless he sent himself, now that he
               considered him as his lord. He invited us to come closer to the city, and if any one
               attempted to come on board the ships at night, he told us to fire upon him with our
               guns. He came out of the stern cabin by the same way by which he had entered it,
               without ever bending his head. At his departure we fired all the cannon.</p>
            <p>This king is a Moor, of about forty-five years of age. rather well made and of a
               handsome presence. He is a very great astrologer. His dress consisted of a shirt of
               very fine white stuff, with the ends of the sleeves embroidered with gold, and a
               wrapper which came down from his waist almost to the ground. He was barefooted; round
               his head he had a silk veil, and over that a garland of flowers. He is named Raja
               Sultan Manzor.</p>
            <p><span class="date">On the 10th of November—a Sunday</span>—we had another
               conversation with the king, who wished to know how long a time we had been absent
               from <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, and what pay and what rations the king
               gave to each of us; and we told him all this. He asked us for a signature of the king
               and a royal standard, since be desired that both his island of <span
                  class="placeName">Tadore</span>, and also that of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> (where he intended to have his nephew named Calanogapi, crowned
               king) should become subject to the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, for
               whose honour he would fight to the death; and if it should happen that he should be
               compelled to give way, he would take refuge in <span class="placeName">Spain</span>
               with all his family, in a new junk which he was having constructed, and would take
               with him the royal signature and standard.</p>
            <p>He begged us to leave with him some of our men, who would always keep alive his
               recollection of us and of our king, as he would more esteem having some of us with
               him than our merchandise, which would not last him a long time. Seeing our eagerness
               to take cloves on board, he said that for that purpose he would go to an island
               called <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, where he hoped to find as much of them
               as were wanted, since in his island there was not a quantity sufficient of dry cloves
               to load the two ships. On that day there was no traffic because it was Sunday. The
               holiday of these people is on Friday.</p>
            <p>It may please your illustrious lordship to have some description of the islands where
               the cloves grow. They are five—<span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, Tador, Mutir,
               Machian, and <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>. <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> is the principal island. Its king, whilst he lived, had almost
               entire dominion over the other four. <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, the
               island in which we were, has its own king. Mutir and Machian have no king, but are
               governed by the people; and when the kings of <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>
               and Tidore are at war, they furnish them with combatants. The last is <span
                  class="placeName">Bachian</span>, and it has a king. All this province in which
               the cloves grow is called <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>.</p>
            <p>When we arrived here, eight months had not elapsed since a certain <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, <span class="persName">Francisco
                  Serrano</span>, had died in <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>. He was
               captain-general of the King of <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span> when he was
               making war on the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>; and he acted so
               strenuously that this king was compelled to give his daughter in marriage to the King
               of <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, who also received as hostages almost all
               the sons of the chief men of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>. Peace was then
               made, and from that daughter was born the nephew Calanopagi, of whom I have spoken.
               But the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> never forgave <span
                  class="persName">Serrano</span> in his heart; and he having come several years
               later to <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> to traffic in cloves, the king had him
               poisoned with some betel leaves, so that he survived hardly four days. The King of
                  <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span> wished to have him buried according to
               their own usage, but three Christian servants that<span class="persName">
                  Serrano</span> had with him did not consent to it. In dying he left a little son
               and a little girl that he had of a lady he had taken in <span class="placeName"
                  >Java</span> major, and two hundred bahars of cloves.</p>
            <p><span class="persName">Francisco Serrano</span> was a great friend and a relation of
               our unfortunate captain-general, and he it was who induced him to undertake that
               voyage, for when <span class="persName">Magellan</span> was at Malacca, he had
               several times learned by letters from <span class="persName">Serrano</span> that he
               was here. Therefore, when <span class="persName">D.Manuel, King of Portugal</span>,
               refused to increase his pension by a single testoon per month, an increase which he
               thought he had well deserved, he came to <span class="placeName">Spain</span> and
               made the proposal to his Sacred Majesty to come here by way of the west, and he
               obtained all that he asked for.</p>
            <p>Ten days after the death of Serrano, the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span>, named Raja Abuleis, drove out from his kingdom his son-in-law
               the King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, whose wife, the daughter of the
               King of <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, came to <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> under the pretext of concluding peace, and gave him (her father)
               such a poison that he only survived two days, and dying left nine sons, whose names
               were told to me as follows: Chochili-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi, Chechilideroix,
               Cilimanzur, Cilipagi, Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu, Serich, and Calanopagi.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday, the 11th of November</span>, <span class="persName"
                  >Chechilideroix</span>, one of the above-mentioned sons of the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, came with two prahus to the ships sounding
               drums: he was dressed in red velvet. We learned that he had near him the widow and
               sons of <span class="persName">Francisco Serrano.</span> When we knew him, being
               aware that he was an enemy of the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, we
               sent to ask him whether we might receive him in the ships, which, as we were in his
               port, we would not do without his consent. The king sent us word to do whatever we
               pleased. But meantime Chechilideroix, seeing our hesitation, had some suspicion, and
               moved further off from the ships. We then went to him in a boat, and made him a
               present of an Indian cloth of gold and silk, with some looking-glasses, knives,
               scissors, etc. : these things he accepted but disdainfully, and soon after departed.
               He had with him an Indian who had become a Christian, named Manuel, the servant of a
               certain Pedro Alfonzo de Lorosa, a <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, who,
               after the death of <span class="persName">Serrano</span>, had come from <span
                  class="placeName">Bandan</span> to <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>. Manuel
               being able to speak <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, came on board the
               ships, and told us that although the sons of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> were enemies to the King of <span class="placeName"
               >Tadore</span>, yet they were disposed towards the service of <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>, Then, by means of him, we wrote to De Lorosa to come to our ships
               without any suspicion or fear.</p>
            <p>These kings have as many ladies as they please, but one only is the principal wife,
               and all the others are subject to her. The King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span> had a large house outside the city, where there were two hundred of
               the ladies he was most fond of, and as many more to serve them. The king eats alone,
               or with his principal wife, on a kind of raised dais, from which he can see all the
               others sitting round, and he decides upon the one who most pleases him to come to
               him. When the king's dinner is finished, the ladies all eat together if he permits
               it, or else each one goes to eat in her own room. No one without special permission
               from the king can see those ladies, and if anybody by day or by night were found near
               their house he would be killed immediately. Each family is bound to give one or two
               daughters to the king. Rajah Sultan Manzour had twenty-six children, of whom eight
               were boys and eighteen girls. In the island of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>
               there is a kind of bishop, and the one that was there in our time had forty ladies
               and very many children.</p>
            <p>On <span class="date">Tuesday the 12th of November</span>, the king had a house built
               in the city for our merchandise, and it was built in one day. Thither we carried all
               that we had to barter, and placed it in the custody of three of our men, and the
               trade began at once. It was carried out in this manner. For ten ells of red cloth of
               pretty good quality they gave a bahar of cloves. A bahar is four quintals and six
               pounds. For fifteen ells of middling quality a bahar, for fifteen hatchets a bahar,
               for thirty-five glass cups a bahar; and the king in this manner had from us almost
               all our goblets: for seventeen cathils of cinnabar a bahar; the same for as much
               quicksilver. For twenty-six ells of common linen a bahar, and the same for
               twenty-five ells of finer linen; for a hundred and fifty knives a bahar; for fifty
               scissors a bahar; for forty caps a bahar; for ten Guzerat cloths a bahar; for three
               of their cymbals two bahars: for a quintal of bronze a bahar. Almost all our mirrors
               were broken, and the few that remained entire the king wished to have. Many of the
               above-mentioned goods had been obtained by us by the capture of the junks, which I
               have related; and the haste we were in to return to <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span> caused us to sell our goods at a lower price than we should have
               done had we not been in a hurry.</p>
            <p>Every day there came to the ships many boats laden with goats, fowls, plantains,
               cocoanuts, and other victuals, that it was a wonder to see. We supplied the ships
               with good water taken from a spring whence it issued hot, but if it remains only one
               hour in the open air it becomes very cold. They say that it comes out like that
               because it issues from the mountain of the cloves. It may be seen from this how those
               lied who said that fresh water had to be brought to <span class="placeName"
                  >Maluco</span> from distant countries.</p>
            <p>The next day the king sent his son named Mossahap to the island of the Mutir for
               cloves with which to freight our ships. We had spoken to the king that day of some
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Indians</span> whom we had captured, and he entreated us
               to make a present of them to him, as he had the intention of sending them back to
               their native country, accompanied by five men of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span>, who, on restoring them to their country, would praise and commend
               the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> and make a good name for the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Spaniards</span>. We gave him the three ladies whom we had
               destined for the queen, as has been said above, and all the men except those of
               Burné: he very much appreciated this gift.</p>
            <p>The king then asked another favour—that was, that we should kill all the pigs we had
               on board, for which he would give an ample compensation in fowls and goats. We gave
               him satisfaction in this, cutting their throats and hanging them up under the deck,
               so that the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> should not have occasion to see
               them, since if by accident they see any pig they covered their faces not to see it or
               perceive its smell.</p>
            <p>In the evening of the same day <span class="persName">Pedro Alfonso</span>, the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, came in a prahu, but before he came on
               board the ships the king sent to call him, and said to him, that although he belonged
               to <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span> he should take good care not to answer
               falsely to the questions we were going to ask him. He indeed, after coming on board,
               told us that he had come to India sixteen years ago, and of these years he had passed
               ten in <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>; and it was just ten years since those
               islands had been discovered by the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, who
               kept the discovery secret from us. He then related to us that a year, less fifteen
               days, had elapsed since a large ship had come hither proceeding from Malacca, and had
               gone away laden with cloves; but that on account of the bad weather, she had been
               obliged to remain some months at Bandam. He added that her captain was Tristan de
               Meneses, a <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, from whom, on asking what
               news there was in Europe, he had heard that a squadron of live ships had sailed from
                  <span class="placeName">Seville</span> to discover <span class="placeName"
                  >Maluco</span> in the name of the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>,
               and that the captain of this squadron was Ferdinand <span class="persName"
                  >Magellan</span>, a <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, for which reason
               the King of Portugal, being angry that a subject of his should attempt to do a thing
               so opposed to him, had sent some ships to the cape of Good Hope, and others to the
               Cape St.a. Maria, where the cannibals are, to impede their passage, but they had not
               fallen in with them. Having learned later that <span class="persName">Magellan</span>
               had passed by another sea, and was making for <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>
               by way of the west, he had written to his Captain-Major of the Indies, named Diogo
               Lopez de Sequeira, to send six ships to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> against
               the Spanish squadron. But the captain-major, having at that time received information
               that the Grand Turk was planning an expedition against Malacca, was obliged to send
               against him sixty sail to the St.raits of Mekkah, in the country of Jiddah, where,
               however, they only found a few galleys which had grounded near the beautiful and
               strong city of Aden, and they set fire to them.</p>
            <p>This enterprise, added De Lorosa, had prevented the captain-major from immediately
               sending an expedition against <span class="persName">Magellan</span>; but a little
               later he had sent to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> a great galleon with two
               rows of cannon, commanded by Francisco Faria, a <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Portuguese</span>: but neither did this one come, for on account of the shoals
               and currents which are near Malacca, and the contrary winds, it was unable to pass
               that promontory, and was compelled to turn back.</p>
            <p>He also related that a few days before a caravel with two junks had come to these
               parts to get news of us. The junks had sailed to <span class="placeName"
                  >Bachian</span> to load cloves, with seven <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Portuguese</span> on board. These men, who did not respect the wives of the
               inhabitants, nor even those of the king, notwithstanding the warning they had
               received from the king himself, were all killed. The men of the caravel, on hearing
               of this, returned in haste to Malacca, abandoning the junks with four hundred bahars
               of cloves and as much merchandise as would have purchased another hundred bahars. He
               also related that every year many junks go from Malacca to <span class="placeName"
                  >Bandan</span> to buy mace and nutmeg, and go thence to <span class="placeName"
                  >Maluco</span> to purchase cloves. They make the voyage from <span
                  class="placeName">Bandan</span> to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> in three
               days, and employ fifteen in the voyage from <span class="placeName">Bandan</span> to
               Malacca. He said, lastly, that since ten years back the King of Portugal had derived
               great profit from these islands, and he took especial care to keep these countries
               concealed from and unknown to the <span class="ethnicGroup">Spaniards</span>. He
               related many other similar things, passing several hours in conversation with us: and
               we said and did so much, offering him a large salary, that we made him determine on
               coming with us to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Friday, the 15th of November</span>, the king told us that he
               thought of going himself to <span class="placeName">Bachian</span> to get the cloves
               which the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> had left there, and asked us
               for presents to give to the two governors of Mutir in the name of the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>. Meanwhile, having come close to our ships, he
               wished to see how we shot with the cross-bow, with guns, and with a swivel gun, which
               is a weapon larger than an arquebuse. He himself fired three times with a cross-bow,
               but he did not care to fire with a gun.</p>
            <p>Opposite <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> there is another very large island,
               called <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span>, and it is so large that a prahu can
               with difficulty go round it in four months. It is inhabited by <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> and <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>.
               The <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> have two kings, one of whom, according to
               what the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> related to us, has had six
               hundred children, and the other has had five hundred and twenty-five. The <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span> have not got so many women as the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span>, and are less superstitious. The first thing they
               meet in the morning when they go out of their houses is the object which they worship
               throughout that day. The king of these <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span> is
               named <span class="persName">Rajah Papua</span>. He is very rich in gold, and
               inhabits the interior of the island. There grow here among the rocks bamboos as thick
               as a man's leg, full of water, which is very good to drink. We purchased many of
               them.</p>
            <p>On <span class="date">Saturday </span>the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moorish</span>
               King of <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span> came to the ships with many prahus,
               and we made him a present of a green damask robe, two ells of red cloth, some
               looking-glasses, scissors, knives, combs, and two gilt goblets, which things pleased
               him very much, and he said to us that, as we were friends of the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Tadore</span>, we were also his friends, since he loved that
               king like one of his own sons. He invited us to come to his country, promising to do
               us great honour. This king is powerful, and held in sufficient respect throughout all
               these islands. He is very old, and his name is Raja Jussu.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Sunday morning</span> this same king came on board the ships and
               wished to see how we fought, and how we discharged the bombards, at which he was
               greatly pleased, for in his youth he had been a great warrior.</p>
            <p>The same day I went on shore to see how the cloves grow, and this is what I observed.
               The tree from which they are gathered is high, and its trunk is as thick as a man's
               body, more or less, according to the age of the plant. Its branches spread out
               somewhat in the middle of the tree, but near the top they form a pyramid. The bark is
               of an olive colour, and the leaves very like those of the laurel. The cloves grow at
               the end of little branches in bunches of ten or twenty. These trees always bear more
               fruit on one side than on the other, according to the seasons. The cloves are white
               when they first sprout, they get red as they ripen, and blacken when dry. They are
               gathered twice in the year, once about Christmas and the other time about St. John's
               day, when the air in these countries is milder, and it is still more so in December.
               When the year is rather hot, and there is little rain, they gather in each of these
               islands from three to four hundred bahars of cloves. The clove tree does not live
               except in the mountains, and if it is transferred to the plain it dies there. The
               leaf, the bark, and the wood, as long as they are green, have the strength and
               fragrance of the fruit itself. If these are not gathered when just ripe they get so
               large and hard that nothing of them remains good except the rind. It is said that the
               mist renders them perfect, and indeed we saw almost every day a mist descend and
               surround one or other of the above-mentioned mountains. Among these people everyone
               possesses some of these trees, and each man watches over his own trees and gathers
               their fruit, but does not do any work round them to cultivate them. This tree does
               not grow except in the five mountains of the five <span class="placeName"
                  >Maluco</span> islands. There are, however, a few trees in <span class="placeName"
                  >Giailolo</span> and in a small island between <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span> and Mutir named Mare, but they are not good.</p>
            <p>There are in this island of <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span> some trees of
               nutmegs. These are like our walnuts, and the leaves also are similar. The nutmeg,
               when gathered, is like the quince in form and colour, and the down which covers it,
               but it is smaller. The outside rind is as thick as the green rind of our walnuts,
               beneath which is a thin web, or rather cartilage, under which is the mace, of a very
               bright red, which covers and surrounds the rind of the nuts, inside which is the
               nutmeg properly so called.</p>
            <p>There also grows in <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> the ginger, which we need
               to eat green, instead of bread. Ginger is not a tree, but a shrub, which sends out of
               the earth shoots a span long like the shoots of canes, which they also resemble in
               the shape of the leaves, only those of the ginger are narrower. The shoots are good
               for nothing; that which makes ginger is the root. When green, it is not so strong as
               when it is dry, and to dry it they use lime, or else it would not keep.</p>
            <p>The houses of these people are built like those already described, but are not so
               high above the ground, and are surrounded with canes after the fashion of a hedge.
               The women here are ugly, and go naked like the others, having only their middles
               covered with cloth made of bark. The men also are naked, and notwithstanding that
               their women are ugly, they are exceedingly jealous; and amongst other things which
               displeased them, was that we came ashore without cloaks, because they imagined that
               might cause temptation to their wives. Both men and women always go barefoot.</p>
            <p>Since I have spoken of cloth, I will relate how they make it. They take a piece of
               bark and leave it in water until it has grown soft; they then beat it with wooden
               clubs to extend it in length and breadth, as much as they please; thus it becomes
               like a veil of raw silk with filaments enlaced within it, so that it appears as if it
               was woven.</p>
            <p>Their bread is made with the wood of a tree like a palm tree, and they make it in
               this way. They take a piece of this wood, and extract from it certain long black
               thorns which are situated there; then they pound it, and make bread of it which they
               call sagu. They make provisions of this bread for their sea voyages.</p>
            <p>Every day there came from <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span> many boats laden
               with cloves, but we, because we were waiting for the king, would not traffic for
               those goods, but only for victuals: and the men of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> complained much of this.</p>
            <p><span class="date">On Sunday night, the 24th of November</span>, the king arrived,
               and on entering the port had his drums sounded, and passed between our ships. We
               fired many bombards to do him honour. He told us that for four days we should be
               continually supplied with cloves.</p>
            <p>In effect, <span class="date">on Monday</span> he sent seven hundred and ninety one
               catils, without taking tare. To take tare means to take spice for less than what it
               weighs, and the reason of this is because when they are fresh, every day they
               diminish in weight. As these were the first cloves which we took on board, and the
               principal object of our voyage, we fired our bombards for joy. Cloves are called
               Gomode in this place; in Sarangani where we took the two pilots they are called
               Bonglavan, and in Malacca Chianche.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Tuesday the 26th November</span> the King came to tell us that for
               us he had done what a King never does here, that was to leave his own island; but he
               had gone to show the affection he had for the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Castile</span>, and because when we had got our cargo, we could sooner return to
                  <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, and afterwards return with greater forces to
               avenge the death of his father, who had been killed in an island called <span
                  class="placeName">Buru</span>, and his body had been thrown into the sea.</p>
            <p>He afterwards added that it was the custom in <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>,
               when the first cloves were embarked in a vessel, or in junks, that the king gave a
               feast to their crews and merchants, and they made prayers to God to bring them in
               safety to their port. He wished to do the same for us, and at the same time the feast
               would serve for the King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, who was coming
               with a brother of his to pay him a visit, and on that account he had the streets
               cleaned. Hearing this, some of us began to suspect some treachery; all the more
               because we learned that, not long before, three <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Portuguese</span> of the companions of Francisco Serrano had been assassinated at
               the place where we got water, by some of the islanders concealed in the thickets;
               also we often saw them whispering with the <span class="ethnicGroup">Indians</span>
               whom we had made prisoners. Therefore, although some of us were inclined to accept
               the invitation, we concluded not to betake ourselves thither, recollecting the
               unfortunate feast given to our men in the island of <span class="placeName"
                  >Zubu</span>, and we decided on a speedy departure.</p>
            <p>Meantime a message was sent to the king to thank him, and to ask him to come soon to
               the ships, where we would deliver to him the four men we had promised him, with the
               goods which we had destined for him. The King came soon, and on entering the ship, as
               though he had observed that we had doubts, said that he entered with as much
               confidence and security as into his own house. He made us feel how much he was
               displeased by our unexpected haste to depart, since ships used to employ thirty days
               in taking in their cargo; and that if he had made a journey out of the island, he
               certainly had not done it to injure us but to assist us, so that we might more
               speedily obtain the cloves which we required, and a part of which we were still
               expecting. He added that it was not then a fit season for navigating in those seas,
               on account of the many shoals near <span class="placeName">Bandan</span>, and besides
               it would be a likely thing that we should fall in with some <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Portuguese</span> ships. When, in spite of what he had said, he saw we were still
               determined on going away, he said that we must take back all that we had given him,
               since the Kings, his neighbours, would consider him as a man without reputation for
               receiving so many presents in the name of so great a king as the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>, and he had given nothing in return, and perhaps
               they would suspect that the <span class="ethnicGroup">Spaniards</span> had gone away
               in such haste for fear of some treachery, so that they would fix upon him the name of
               traitor. Then, in order that no suspicion might remain in our minds of his honesty
               and good faith, he ordered his Koran to be brought, and kissing it devoutly he placed
               it four or five times on his head whilst whispering certain words to himself, with a
               rite which they call Zambehan, and he said in the presence of us all, that he swore
               by Allah and by the Koran, which he held in his hand, that he would ever be faithful
               and a friend to the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. He said all this
               almost weeping and with so great an appearance of sincerity and cordiality, that we
               promised to prolong our sojourn at <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> for another
               fortnight. We then gave him the Royal signature and standard. We learned later, by a
               sure and certain channel, that some of the chiefs of those islands had indeed
               counselled him to kill all of us, by which thing he would have acquired for himself
               great merit with the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, who would have
               given him good assistance to avenge himself on the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Bachian</span>, but he, loyal and constant to the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>, with whom he had sworn a peace, had answered that he would never do
               such an act on any account whatever.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Wednesday, the 27th November</span>, the king issued a
               proclamation that whoever had cloves might freely sell them to us. For which reason
               all that and the following day, we bought cloves like mad.</p>
            <p>Friday, in the afternoon, the governor of Machian came with many prahus, but he would
               not come on shore, because his father and his brother, who had been banished from
                  <span class="placeName">Machian</span>, had taken refuge here.</p>
            <p>The following day the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, with his nephew,
               the governor, named Humai, a man of twenty-five years of age, came on board the
               ships, and the king, on hearing that we had no more cloth, sent to fetch from his
               house six ells of red cloth, and gave them to us in order that we might, by adding
               other objects, make a fitting present to the governor. We made him the present, and
               he thanked us much, and said that soon he would send us plenty of cloves. At his
               departure from the ship we fired several bombards.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Sunday the 1st day of December</span>, the above-mentioned
               governor departed from <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>; and we were told that
               the king had made him a present of some silk cloths and drums, for him to send us the
               cloves sooner. On Monday, the king himself went again out of the island for the same
               object. Wednesday morning, as it was the day of St. Barbara, and on account of the
               King's arrival all the artillery was discharged. The king came to the beach to see
               how we fired rockets and fire balls, and took great pleasure in them.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Thursday and Friday</span> we purchased a good many cloves both in
               the city and at the ships at a much lower price, as the time of our departure grew
               nearer. For four ells of riband they gave a bahar of cloves, for two little chains of
               brass which were worth a marcello, they gave us a hundred pounds; and at last each
               man being desirous of having his portion of the cargo, and as there were no more
               goods to give in exchange for cloves, one gave his cloak, another his coat, and
               another a shirt or other clothes to obtain them.</p>
            <p>On Saturday three sons of the King of <span class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, with
               their wives, who were daughters of our King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>,
               and afterwards <span class="persName">Pedro Alfonso</span>, the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, came to the ships. We gave a gilt glass
               goblet to each of the brothers, and to the three wives scissors and other things; and
               when they went away we fired several bombards in their honour. We afterwards sent on
               shore a present of several things to the widow of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span>, daughter of the King <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, who
               had not ventured to come on board the ships.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Sunday the 8th December</span>, we fired many bombards, rockets,
               and fireballs to celebrate the Conception of our Lady. Monday in the afternoon, the
               King came to the ships with three women who carried his betel. It is to be observed
               that no one can take women about with him except the king. Afterwards the King of
                  <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span> came to see again our gun exercise.</p>
            <p>Some days later, as the day of our departure grew near, the king showed us a sincere
               affection, and among other obliging things, said to us that it seemed to him that he
               was a sucking child whom its mother was about to leave, and that he remained
               disconsolate all the more now that he had become acquainted with us and liked several
               things of <span class="placeName">Spain</span>, for which reason he entreated us not
               to delay our return thence to <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>. Meantime, he
               begged us to leave him some of our swivel guns for his own defence. He warned us at
               the same time not to navigate except by daylight, on account of the shoals and reefs
               which exist in these seas; but we answered him that because of our need to arrive in
                  <span class="placeName">Spain</span> as soon as possible, we were obliged to
               navigate night and day: he then added that, being unable to do anything else, he
               would pray God every day to bring us home in safety.</p>
            <p>During this time <span class="persName">Pedro Alfonso</span> de Lorosa had come to
               the ships with his wife and property to return with us. Two days after, <span
                  class="persName">Kechilideroix</span>, son of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span>, came with a prahu well filled with men, and approaching the
               ships requested Lorosa to come into his prahu; but Lorosa, who suspected him, refused
               to do so, and told him he had determined on going away with those ships to <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>. For the same suspicion he advised us not to
               receive him in the ships; and we did not choose that he should come on board when he
               asked to do so. It was known later that Kechili was a great friend of the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> captain of Malacca, and had the intention of
               seizing Lorosa and of conducting him thither; and on that account he severely
               reprimanded those persons with whom this <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>
               lived, for having let him depart without his permission.</p>
            <p>The king had informed us that the King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>
               would soon arrive, with a brother of his who was going to marry one of his daughters,
               and had asked us to do him honour by firing bombards on his arrival. He arrived on
               Sunday the 15th of December, in the afternoon, and we did him honour as the king had
               desired; we did not, however, discharge the heavier cannon, as we were heavily laden.
               The king and his brother came in a prahu with three banks of rowers on each side, a
               hundred and twenty in number. The prahu was adorned with many streamers made of
               white, yellow and red parrot's feathers. They were sounding many cymbals, and that
               sound served to give the measure to the rowers to keep time. In two other prahus were
               the damsels who were to be presented to the bride. They returned us the salute by
               going round the ships and round the port.</p>
            <p>As it is the custom that no king disembarks on the land of another king, the King of
                  <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> came to visit him of <span class="placeName"
                  >Bachian</span> in his own prahu: this one, seeing the other coming, rose from the
               carpet on which he was sitting, and placed himself on one side to make way for the
               king of the country; but he, out of ceremony, would not sit on the carpet, but sat on
               the other side of it, leaving the carpet between them. Then the King of <span
                  class="placeName">Bachian</span> gave to him of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span> five hundred patol, as if in payment of the daughter he was giving
               as a wife to his brother. Patols are cloths of gold and silk worked in <span
                  class="placeName">China</span>, and are very much prized in these islands. Each of
               these cloths is paid for with three bahars of cloves more or less, according as they
               are more or less rich in gold and embroidery. Whenever one of the chief men die, his
               relations put on these cloths to do him honour.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday</span>, the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>
               sent a dinner to the king of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, carried by fifty
               women clothed with silk from their waists to their knees. They went two and two with
               a man between in the midst of them. Each one carried a large dish upon which were
               small dishes with various viands; ten of the oldest of these women were the
               mace-bearers. They proceeded in this way to the prahu, and presented everything to
               the king who was sitting on a carpet under a red and yellow canopy. As they were
               returning, they caught some of our men who had come out of curiosity and who were
               obliged to make them presents of some trifle to get free. After that the king sent
               also to us a present of goats, cocoanuts, wine, and other things.</p>
            <p>This day we bent on the ships new sails, upon which was the cross of St. James, of
               Gallicia, with letters which said: "This is the figure of our good fortune."</p>
            <p><span class="date">Tuesday</span>, we presented to the king some pieces of artillery;
               that is some arquebuses which we had taken as prizes in the Indies, and some of our
               swivel-guns with four barrels of powder. We took on board each ship eighty barrels of
               water. Wood we were to find at the island of Mare, where the king had already five
               days ago sent a hundred men to prepare it, and near which we were to pass.</p>
            <p>This day, the King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, with the consent of the
               King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, came on shore, preceded by four men
               holding up daggers in their hands, to make alliance with us: he said, in the presence
               of the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> and of all his suite, that he
               would always be ready for the service of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>, that he would keep in his name the cloves left in his island by the
                  <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, until another Spanish squadron
               arrived there, and he would not give them up without his consent. He sent through us
               to the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> a present of a slave and two
               bahars of cloves. He would have wished to have sent ten bahars, but our ships were so
               heavily laden, that we could not receive any more.</p>
            <p>He also gave us for the King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> two most
               beautiful dead birds. These birds are as large as thrushes; they have small heads,
               long beaks, legs slender like a writing pen, and a span in length; they have no
               wings, but instead of them long feathers of different colours, like plumes: their
               tail is like that of the thrush. All the feathers, except those of the wings, are of
               a dark colour; they never fly, except when the wind blows. They told us that these
               birds come from the terrestrial Paradise, and they call them "bolon dinata" that is
               divine birds.</p>
            <p>The King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span> was a man of about seventy years
               of age Not only did the King of <span class="placeName">Bachian</span> recognise the
               King of <span class="placeName">Spain</span> as his Sovereign; but every king of
                  <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> wrote to him that he desired always to be
               his faithful subject.</p>
            <p>One day the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> sent to tell our men, who
               dwelt in the magazine for the merchandise, that they should take care not to go out
               of the house by night, since there were certain men, natives of the country, who by
               anointing themselves, walk by night in the shape of men without heads: and if they
               meet anyone to whom they wish ill, they touch his hand and anoint his palm, and that
               ointment causes him soon to grow ill, and die at the end of three or four days. But
               if they meet three or four persons together they do not touch them, but make them
               giddy. He added that he had a watch kept to discover them, and he had already had
               several executed.</p>
            <p>When they build a new house, before going to inhabit it, they make a fire round it,
               and give many feasts there. Then they fasten to the roof of the house a pattern or
               sample of everything that is to be found in the island, persuaded that by that means
               none of those things will be ever wanting to whoever inhabits the house.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Wednesday</span> morning everything was prepared for our departure
               from <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>. The Kings of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span>, of <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span>, and of <span
                  class="placeName">Bachian</span>, and a son of the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tarenate</span> had come to accompany us as far as the island of Mare. The ship
               "Victoria" made sail and stood out a little, waiting for the ship "Trinity"; but she
               had much difficulty in getting up the anchor, and meanwhile the sailors perceived
               that she was leaking very much in the hold. Then the "Victoria" returned to anchor in
               her former position. They began to discharge the cargo of the "Trinity" to see if the
               leak could be stopped, for it was perceived that the water came in with force as
               through a pipe, but we were never able to find out at what part it came in. All that
               day and the next we did nothing else but work at the pumps, but without any
               advantage. Hearing this, the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> came at
               once to the ships, and occupied himself with us in searching for the leak. For this
               purpose he sent into the sea five of his men, who were accustomed to remain a long
               time under the water, and although they remained more than half-an-hour they could
               not find the fissure. As the water inside the ship continually increased, the king,
               who was as much affected by it as we were, and lamenting this misfortune, sent to the
               end of the island for three other men, more skilful than the first at remaining under
               water.</p>
            <p>He came with them early the next morning. These men dived under water with their hair
               loose, thinking that their hair, attracted by the water which penetrated into the
               ship, would indicate to them the leak, but though they remained more than an hour in
               the water, they did not find it. The king, seeing that there was no remedy for it,
               said with lamentation, "Who will go to <span class="placeName">Spain</span> to take
               news of me to the king our lord?" We answered him that the "Victoria" would go there,
               and would sail at once to take advantage of the east winds, which had already
               commenced. The "Trinity," meanwhile, would be refitted and would wait for the west
               winds and go to Darien, which is on the other side of the sea, in the country of
               Diucatan. The king approved our thoughts, and said that he had in his service two
               hundred and twenty-five carpenters who would do all the work under the direction of
               our men, and that those who should remain there would be treated as his own children,
               and he said this with so much emotion that he moved us all to tears.</p>
            <p>We, who were on board the "Victoria," fearing that she might open, on account of the
               heavy cargo and the long voyage, lightened her by discharging sixty hundred weight of
               cloves, which we had carried to the house where the crew of the "Trinity" were
               lodged. Some of our own crew preferred to remain at <span class="placeName"
                  >Maluco</span> rather than go with us to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>,
               because they feared that the ship could not endure so long a voyage, and because,
               mindful of how much they had suffered, they feared to die of hunger in mid-ocean.</p>
            <p>Saturday, <span class="date">the 2lst December</span>, day of St. Thomas the Apostle,
               the King of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> came to the ships and brought us
               the two pilots, whom we had already paid, to conduct us out of these islands. They
               said that the weather was then good for sailing at once, but, having to wait for the
               letters of our companions who remained behind, and who wished to write to <span
                  class="placeName">Spain</span>, we could not sail till midday. Then the ships took
               leave of one another by a mutual discharge of bombards. Our men accompanied us for
               some distance with their boat, and then with tears and embraces we separated. Juan
               Carvalho remained at <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> with fifty-three of our
               men; we were forty-seven Europeans and thirteen <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Indians</span>. </p>
            <p>The king's governor came with us as far as the island of Mare: we had hardly arrived
               there when four prahus laden with wood came up, which in less than an hour we got on
               board. We then took the south-west course. </p>
            <p>In all the above-mentioned islands of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> are to be
               found cloves, ginger, sagu, which is their bread made of wood, rice, cocoa-nuts,
               plantains, almonds larger than ours, sweet and bitter pomegranates, sugar-canes, oil
               of cocoa and of sesame, melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, comilicai, which is a refreshing
               fruit the size of a water-melon, another fruit like a peach called guave, and other
               eatable vegetables. They also have goats and fowls, honey produced by bees not larger
               than ants, which make their hives in trunks of trees. There are also parrots of many
               kinds, and amongst them there are white ones called Catara, and red ones called Nori,
               which are the most sought after, not so much for the beauty of their plumage, as
               because they talk more clearly. One of these is sold for a bahar of cloves. </p>
            <p>It is hardly fifty years since the <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> conquered
                  <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> and dwelt there. Before that, these islands
               were inhabited only by <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, who did not care
               for the cloves. There are still some families of them who have taken refuge in the
               mountains, where the cloves grow. </p>
            <p>The island of <span class="placeName">Tadore</span> is in 0 deg.27 min. North
               latitude, and 161 deg.west of the line of demarcation; it is 9 deg.30 min. distant
               from the first island of this archipelago, named <span class="placeName"
               >Zamal</span>, to the south-east and a quarter south. The island of <span
                  class="placeName">Tarenate</span> is in 0 deg. 40 min. of N. latitude.Mutir is
               exactly under the equinoctial line.Machian is in 0 deg.15 min.S.latitude, and <span
                  class="placeName">Bachian</span> in 1 deg.of the same latitude. <span
                  class="placeName">Tarenate</span>, <span class="placeName">Tadore</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Mutir</span>, and <span class="placeName">Machian</span>, are
               like four high and pointed mountains, upon which the clove trees grow. <span
                  class="placeName">Bachian</span> is not visible from these four islands, but it is
               a larger island than any of those. Its clove mountain is not so high nor so pointed
               as those of the other islands, but it has a larger base.</p> (Book IV of the Milan
            Edition.) Return from the Moluccas to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>
            <p>Pursuing our voyage, after having taken in wood at the islet of Mare, we passed
               between the following islands:—<span class="placeName">Caioan</span>,<span
                  class="placeName"> Laigoma</span>, <span class="placeName">Sico</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Giogi</span>, <span class="placeName">Cafi</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Laboan Toliman</span>, <span class="placeName">Titameti</span>,
                  <span class="placeName">Bachian</span>, <span class="placeName">Latalata</span>,
                  <span class="placeName">Jabobi</span>, <span class="placeName">Mata</span>, and
                  <span class="placeName">Batutiga</span>. They told us that in the island of <span
                  class="placeName">Cafi</span> the people were small and dwarfed like the Pigmies;
               they have been subjected by force by the King of <span class="placeName"
                  >Tadore</span>. We passed outside of Batutiga to the west, and we steered between
               west and south-west, and we discovered some islets to the south, on which account the
               pilots of <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> said it would be better to cast
               anchor so as not to drift at night among many islets and shoals. We, therefore,
               altered our course to south-east, and went to an island situated in 2 deg.S.latitude,
               and fifty-three leagues from <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>.</p>
            <p>This island is named <span class="placeName">Sulach</span>; its inhabitants are <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, and have not got a king. They eat human
               flesh; both men and women go naked, except a piece of the bark of a tree of two
               fingers' breath before their natural parts. There are many other islands around here
               inhabited by anthropophagi. These are the names of some of them:—<span
                  class="placeName">Silan</span>,<span class="placeName"> Noselao</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Biga</span>,<span class="placeName"> Atulabaon</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Leitimor</span>, <span class="placeName">Tenetum</span>,<span
                  class="placeName"> Gonda</span>, <span class="placeName">Kailaruru</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Mandan</span> and <span class="placeName">Benaia</span>. We left
               to the east the islands named <span class="placeName">Lamatola</span> and <span
                  class="placeName">Tenetum.</span></p>
            <p>Having run ten leagues from <span class="placeName">Sulach</span> in the same
               direction, we went to a rather large island named <span class="placeName"
               >Buru</span>, in which we found plenty of victuals, such as pigs, goats, fowls,
               sugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, sagu, a certain food of theirs made of bananas called
               kanali,and chiacare, which here they call Nanga. The chiacare are fruit like
               water-melons, but knotty on the outside; inside they have some small red fruit like
               plums, they have not got a stone in the middle, but instead of that have a certain
               pith like a white bean, but larger, they are tender to eat like chestnuts. We found
               here another fruit which externally is like a pine cone, and it is yellow, but white
               inside; on cutting, it is something like a pear, but much softer and better tasted.
               Here it is called comilicai. The inhabitants of this island are <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, and have no king: they go naked like those of
                  <span class="placeName">Sulach</span>. The island of <span class="placeName"
                  >Buru</span> is in 3 deg. 30 min. S. latitude, and seventy-five leagues from <span
                  class="placeName">Maluco</span>.</p>
            <p>To the east of this island, at a distance of ten leagues, there is another one
               larger, and which borders on <span class="placeName">Giailolo</span>, and it is
                  named<span class="placeName">Ambon</span>. It is inhabited by <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> and <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>,
               but the former are on the sea shore, and the others in the interior; these are also
               anthropophagi. The products of this island are the same as those of <span
                  class="placeName">Buru</span>. Between <span class="placeName">Buru</span> and
                  <span class="placeName">Ambon</span>, there are three islands surrounded by reefs
               named <span class="placeName">Vudia</span>, <span class="placeName">Kailaruru</span>
               and <span class="placeName">Benaia.</span> To the south of <span class="placeName"
                  >Buru</span>, at a distance of four leagues, is another small island named
               Ambalao.</p>
            <p>At thirty-five leagues from <span class="placeName">Buru</span>, south and a quarter
               south-west, is <span class="placeName">Bandan</span>, with thirteen other islands. In
               six of them grow mace and nutmeg. <span class="placeName">Zoroboa</span> is the
               largest of them, <span class="placeName">Chelicel</span>, <span class="placeName"
                  >Saniananpi</span>, <span class="placeName">Pulai</span>, <span class="placeName"
                  >Puluru</span>, and <span class="placeName">Rasoghin</span>, the other six are
               Unuveru, Pulanbaracan, Lailaca, Mamica, Man, and Meut. In these islands nutmegs are
               not found, but only sagu, rice, cocoanuts, bananas, and other fruits, and they are
               near one another. The inhabitants of these are <span class="ethnicGroup"
               >Moors</span>, and have no king. <span class="placeName">Bandan</span> is in 6 deg.of
               S.latitude, and 163 deg.30 min.longitude from the line of demarcation. As this island
               was a little out of our course, we did not go to it.</p>
            <p>Leaving the island of <span class="placeName">Buru</span> in the direction south-west
               and a quarter west, about eight degrees of latitude,we arrived at three other islands
               near each other named <span class="placeName">Zolo</span>t, Nocemamor, and Galian.
               Whilst we sailed amidst these islands, a great storm fell upon us, for which we made
               a vow of a pilgrimage to our Lady della Guida. We put the ship before the storm and
               made for a rather high island, which afterwards we learned was named <span
                  class="placeName">Mallua</span>, but before we could reach it, we had to struggle
               much with the squalls of wind which descended from the mountains and with the
               currents. The inhabitants of this island are savages, and more beasts than men; they
               eat human flesh; they go naked, except the usual piece of bark to cover their natural
               parts. But when they go to fight they wear on the back, the breast, and the flanks,
               pieces of buffalo hide, ornamented with shells, and boars' tusks, and tails of goat
               skins, hanging before and behind. They wear the hair raised high up by means of cane
               combs with long teeth, which go through it. They wrap up their beards with leaves,
               and enclose them in cases or tubes of reed, a thing which seemed to us very
               ridiculous. In one word these were the ugliest men we had seen in these Indies. Both
               their bows and arrows are made of reeds, and they carry their food in bags made of
               leaves. When their women saw us they came towards us with their bows drawn, but when
               we had given them some presents we soon became friends.</p>
            <p>We passed fifteen days in this island in caulking the ship whose sides had suffered.
               We found here goats, fowls, wax, cocoanuts, and pepper. For a pound of old iron they
               gave fifteen pounds of wax or of pepper.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of pepper here, the long and the round. The long pepper is like
               the flower of the hazel tree in winter; its plant is like ivy, and like it clings to
               trees; its leaves are like those of the mulberry tree; it is called luli. The round
               pepper grows like the other, but its fruit is in ears like Indian corn, and the
               grains are pulled off in the same manner; it is called lada. The fields here are full
               of pepper plants.</p>
            <p>Here we took a man to conduct us to some island where we could find plenty of
               victuals.</p>
            <p>The island of <span class="placeName">Mallua</span> is in 8 deg. 30 min.S.latitude,
               and 169 deg.40 min.longitude from the line of demarcation.</p>
            <p>The old pilot from <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> related to us, whilst
               sailing, that in this neighbourhood there was an island named Aruchete, the
               inhabitants of which, men and women, are not more than one cubit high, and they have
               ears as large and as long as themselves, so that when they lie down one serves them
               for a mattress, and with the other they cover themselves. They are shorn and naked,
               their voices are shrill, and they run very swiftly. They dwell under ground, live on
               fish and a certain substance which grows between the bark and the wood of a tree,
               which is white and round like coriander comfits, and which is named ambulon. We would
               have gone there willingly, but the shoals and currents did not allow of it.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Saturday the 25th of January, (1522)</span>, at 22 o'clock, we
               left the island of <span class="placeName">Mallua;</span> and the following day,
               having run five leagues to the south-south-east, we arrived at a large island called
                  <span class="placeName">Timor</span>. I went ashore alone to speak to the head man
               of a village named Amaban, about his providing us with victuals. He offered me
               buffaloes, pigs, and goats, but when it was a question of the goods which he wanted
               in exchange, we could not come to an agreement, because he asked a great deal, and we
               had got very little to give. Then as we were constrained by hunger, we took the
               measure of detaining on board the ship the chief of another village named Balibo, who
               had come there in good faith with a son of his; and we imposed upon him as a ransom
               for recovering his liberty, to give six buffaloes, ten pigs, and ten goats. He, being
               much afraid that we should kill him, quickly gave orders to have all this brought to
               us; and as there were only five goats and two pigs they gave us instead an additional
               buffalo. We then sent him ashore with his son, and he was well pleased when we not
               only left him free, but also gave him some linen, some Indian cloths of silk and
               cotton, some hatchets, some Indian knives, scissors, looking-glasses, and some of our
               knives.</p>
            <p>The chief man, whom I went to speak to first, has only women in his service; all were
               naked like those of the neighbouring islands, and wear in their ears small gold rings
               with tufts of silk hanging from them; on their arms they wear many rings of gold and
               copper, which often cover them up to the elbow. The men are naked like the women, and
               wear attached to their necks round plates of gold, and on their heads reed combs
               ornamented with gold rings. Some of them, instead of gold rings, wore in their ears
               dried necks of gourds.</p>
            <p>In this island there are buffaloes, pigs, and goats, as has been said; there are also
               fowls and parrots of various colours. There is also rice, bananas, ginger, sugar
               canes, oranges, lemons, beans and almonds.</p>
            <p>We had approached that part of the island where there were some villages with their
               chiefs or head men. On the other side of the island are the dwellings of four kings,
               and their districts are named <span class="placeName">Oibich</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Lichsana</span>, <span class="placeName">Suai</span>, and <span
                  class="placeName">Cabanaza</span>. Oibich is the largest place. We were told that
               in a mountain near <span class="placeName">Cabanaza</span>, very much gold is found,
               and its inhabitants buy whatever they want with small pieces of gold. All the trade
               in sandal wood and wax, carried on by the people of Malacca and <span
                  class="placeName">Java</span>, is done here; and indeed, we found here a junk
               which had come from Lozon to trade in sandal wood; for white sandal wood only grows
               in this country.</p>
            <p>These people are <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>; we were told that when
               they go to cut sandal wood, the devil appears to them in various forms, and tells
               them that if they want anything they should ask him for it; but this apparition
               frightens them so much, that they are ill of it for some days. The sandal wood is cut
               at a certain phase of the moon, and it is asserted that if cut at another time it
               would not be good. The merchandise most fitting for bartering here for sandal wood is
               red cloth, linen, hatchets, iron, and nails.</p>
            <p>This island is entirely inhabited. It extends a long way from east to west, and
               little from north to south. Its south latitude is in 10 deg., and the longitude 174
               deg.30 min. from the line of demarcation.</p>
            <p>In all these islands that we visited in this archipelago, the evil of Saint Job
               prevailed, and more here than in any other place, where they call it "for franki",
               that is to say, <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> illness.</p>
            <p>We were told that at a day's voyage, west-north-west from <span class="placeName"
                  >Timor</span>, there was an island in which much cinnamon grows, called Ende; its
               inhabitants are <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>, and have no king. Near
               this are many others forming a series of islands as far as <span class="placeName"
                  >Java Major</span>, and the <span class="placeName">Cape of Malacca</span>. The
               names of these islands are Ende, Tanabuton, Crenochile, Bimacore, Azanaran, Main,
               Zubava, Lombok, Chorum, and <span class="placeName">Java Major</span>, which by the
               inhabitants is not called <span class="placeName">Java</span> but Jaoa.</p>
            <p>In this island of <span class="placeName">Java</span> are the largest towns; the
               principal of them is Magepaher the king of which, when he lived, was the greatest of
               all the kings of the neighbouring islands, and he was named Raja Patiunus Sunda. Much
               pepper grows there. The other towns are—Dahadama, Gagiamada, Minutarangam,
               Ciparafidain, Tuban, Cressi, and Cirubaya. At half a league from <span
                  class="placeName">Java Major</span> are the islands of <span class="placeName"
                  >Bali</span>, called <span class="placeName">Java</span> Minor, and <span
                  class="placeName">Madura</span>, these are of equal size.</p>
            <p>They told us that in <span class="placeName">Java Major</span>, it was the custom
               when one of the chief men died, to burn his body; and then his principal wife,
               adorned with garlands of flowers, has herself carried in a chair by four men
               throughout the town, with a tranquil and smiling countenance, whilst comforting her
               relations, who are afflicted because she is going to burn herself with the corpse of
               her husband, and encouraging them not to lament, saying to them, "I am going this
               evening to sup with my dear husband, and to sleep with him this night. " Afterwards,
               when close to the place of the pyre, she again turns towards the relations, and after
               again consoling them, casts herself into the fire and is burned. If she did not do
               this she would not be looked upon as an honourable woman, nor as a faithful wife.</p>
            <p>Our old pilot related to us other extravagant things. He told us that the young men
               of <span class="placeName">Java</span>. and that in an island called Ocoloro, below
                  <span class="placeName">Java Major</span>, there are only women who become
               pregnant with the wind, and when they bring it forth, if the child is a male, they
               kill it, and if a female, they bring it up; and if any man visits their island,
               whenever they are able to kill him, they do so.</p>
            <p>They also related to us that beyond <span class="placeName">Java Major</span>,
               towards the north in the Gulf of <span class="placeName">China</span>, which the
               ancients named Sinus Magnus, there is an enormous tree named Campanganghi, in which
               dwell certain birds named Garuda, so large that they take with their claws, and carry
               away flying, a buffalo, and even an elephant, to the place of the tree, which place
               is named Puzathaer. The fruit of this tree is called Buapanganghi, and is larger than
               a water melon. The <span class="ethnicGroup">Moors</span> of Burné, whom we had with
               us in the ships, told as they had seen two of these birds, which had been sent to
               their king from the kingdom of <span class="placeName">Siam</span>. No junk, or other
               vessel, can approach this tree within three or four leagues, on account of the great
               whirlpools which the water makes there. They related to us, moreover, how in a
               wonderful manner what is related of this tree became known, for a junk, having been
               carried there by the whirlpools, was broken up, and all the seamen perished, except a
               child who attached himself to a plank and was miraculously borne near the tree, upon
               which he mounted. There he placed himself under the wing of one of these birds, which
               was asleep, without its perceiving him, and next day the bird having taken flight
               carried him with it, and having seen a buffalo on the land, descended to take it; the
               child took advantage of the opportunity to come out from under its wing, and remained
               on the ground. In this manner the story of these birds and of the tree became known,
               and it was understood that those fruits which are frequently found in the sea came
               from that place.</p>
            <p>We were told that there were in that kingdom, on the banks of the rivers, certain
               birds which feed on carrion, but which will not touch it unless another bird has
               first eaten its heart. </p>
            <p>The <span class="placeName">Cape of Malacca</span> is in 1 deg.30 min.of S.latitude.
               To the east of that Cape are many cities and towns, of a few of which I will note the
               names—Singapola, which is at the Cape, Pahan, Kalantan, Patani, Bradlini, Benan,
               Lagon, Cheregigharan, Trombon, Joran, Ciu, Brabri, Banga, Iudia, Jandibum, Laun,
               Langonpifa. All these cities are constructed like ours, and are subject to the King
               of <span class="placeName">Siam</span> who is named Siri Zacabedera, and who inhabits
               Iudia.</p>
            <p>Beyond <span class="placeName">Siam</span> is situated Camogia; its king is named
                  <span class="persName">Saret Zacabedera</span>; next Chiempa, the king of which is
               named <span class="persName">Raja Brahami Martu</span>. There grows the rhubarb, and
               it is found in this manner: men go together in companies of twenty or twenty-five, to
               the woods, and at night ascend the trees, both to get out of the way of the lions,
               the elephants, and other wild beasts, and also to be able better to smell the odour
               of the rhubarb borne to them by the wind. In the morning they go to that quarter
               whence they have perceived that the odour comes, and seek for the rhubarb till they
               find it. This is the rotten wood of a large tree, which acquires its odour by
               putrefaction. The best part of the tree is the root, but the trunk is also good,
               which is called Calama.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of <span class="placeName">Cocchi</span> lies next, its sovereign is
               named <span class="persName">Raja Seri Bummipala</span>. After that follows Great
                  <span class="placeName">China</span>, the king of which is the greatest sovereign
               of the world, and is called Santoa raja. He has seventy crowned kings under his
               dependence; and some of these kings have ten or fifteen lesser kings dependent on
               them. The port of this kingdom is named <span class="placeName">Guantan</span>, and
               among the many cities of this empire, two are the most important, namely<span
                  class="placeName"> Nankin</span> and <span class="placeName">Comlaha</span>, where
               the king usually resides.</p>
            <p>He has four of his principal ministers close to his palace, at the four sides looking
               to the four cardinal winds, that is, one to the west, one to the east, to the south,
               and to the north. Each of these gives audience to those that come from his quarter.
               All the kings and lords of India major and superior obey this king, and in token of
               their vassalage, each is obliged to have in the middle of the principal place of his
               city the marble figure of a certain animal named Chinga, an animal more valiant than
               the lion; the figure of this animal is also engraved on the king's seal, and all who
               wish to enter his port must carry the same emblem in wax or ivory.</p>
            <p>If any lord is disobedient to him, he is flayed, and his skin, dried in the sun,
               salted, and stuffed, is placed in an eminent part of the public place, with the head
               inclined and the hands on the head in the attitude of doing zongu, that is obeisance
               to the king.</p>
            <p>He is never visible to anybody; and if he wishes to see his people, he is carried
               about the palace on a peacock most skilfully manufactured, and very richly adorned,
               with six ladies dressed exactly like himself, so that he cannot be distinguished from
               them. He afterwards passes into a richly-adorned figure of a serpent called Naga,
               which has a large glass in the breast, through which he and the ladies are seen, but
               it is not possible to distinguish which is the king. He marries his sisters in order
               that his blood should not mix with that of others.</p>
            <p>His palace has seven walls round it, and in each circle there are daily ten thousand
               men on guard, who are changed every twelve hours at the sound of a bell. Each wall
               has its gate, with a guard at each gate. At the first stands a man with a great
               scourge in his hand, named Satuhoran with Satubagan; at the second a dog called
               Satuhain; at the third, a man with an iron mace, called Satuhoran with pocumbecin; at
               the fourth, a man with a bow in his hand, called Satuhoran with anatpanan; at the
               fifth, a man with a lance, called Satuhoran, with tumach; at the sixth, a lion called
               Satuhorimau; at the seventh, two white elephants called Gagiapute.</p>
            <p>The palace contains seventy-nine halls, in which dwell only the ladies destined to
               serve the king; there are always torches burning there. It is not possible to go
               round the palace in less than a day. In the upper part of it are four halls where the
               ministers go to speak to the king: one is ornamented with metal, both the pavement
               and the walls; another is all of silver, another all of gold, and the other is set
               with pearls and precious stones. The gold and other valuable things which are brought
               as tribute to the king are placed in these rooms; and when they are there deposited,
               they say, Let this be for the honour and glory of our Santoa Raja. All these things
               and many others relating to this king, were narrated to us by a Moor, who said that
               he had seen them.</p>
            <p>The Chinese are white, and are clothed; they eat on tables like us. They have
               crosses, but it is not known why they have them.</p>
            <p>It is from <span class="placeName">China</span> that musk comes; the animal which
               produces it is a kind of cat, like the civet cat; it eats nothing but a certain soft
               wood, slender as a finger, named chamaru. To extract the musk from this animal they
               attach a leech to it, and leave it till it is full of blood, and when they see that
               it is well filled, they crush it, and collect the blood in a plate, and put it in the
               sun for four or five days, moistening it every day with urine. In this way it becomes
               perfect musk. Whoever keeps one of these cats pays a tribute to the king. The grains
               of musk which come to Europe as musk, are only small pieces of kid's flesh soaked in
               real musk, and not the blood, since though it can be made into grains, it easily
               evaporates. The cat which produces musk is called castor, and the leech is called
               Linta.</p>
            <p>Continuing along the coast of <span class="placeName">China</span>, many nations are
               met with, and they are these: the Chienchi, who inhabit the islands in which they
               fish for pearls, and where the cinnamon grows. The Lecchii inhabit the mainland: the
               entrance to their port is traversed by a large rock, for which reason all the junks
               and vessels which wish to enter must take down their masts. The king of this country
               is called Moni. He has on the mainland twenty kings under him, and he is subject to
               the King of <span class="placeName">China</span>: his capital is Baranaci, and here
               is situated Oriental Cathay. Han is a high and cold island, where there is copper,
               silver, pearls, and silk; its king is named <span class="persName">Raja Zotra</span>.
               There is also Miliaula, the king of which is named Raja Quetischeniga, and Guio, the
               king of which is Raja Sudacali. These places are cold and on the mainland. Friagonba
               and Trianga are two islands which also produce copper, silver, pearls, and silk;
               their king is <span class="persName">Raja Ruzon</span>. Bassi is a low land on the
               continent. There come afterwards <span class="placeName">Sumbdit</span> and <span
                  class="placeName">Pradit</span>, two islands very rich in gold, where the men wear
               a large ring of gold round the ancle. In the neighbouring mountains dwell people who
               kill their parents when they are old, so that they may cease from travail. All the
               people of these countries are <span class="ethnicGroup">Gentiles</span>.</p>
            <p>Tuesday night (between it and Wednesday,) on the <span class="date">11th of February
                  of 1522</span>, we left the island of <span class="placeName">Timor</span>, and
               entered upon the great sea named <span class="placeName">Laut Chidol</span> and
               taking a west-south-west course, we left to the right and to the North, from fear of
               the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, the island of <span
                  class="placeName">Zumatra</span>, anciently named <span class="placeName"
                  >Taprobana</span>; also <span class="placeName">Pegu</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Bengala</span>, <span class="placeName">Urizza</span>, <span
                  class="placeName">Chelim</span>, where are the Malabars, subjects of the King of
               Narsinga: Calicut which is under the same king; Cambaya in which are the Guzeratis;
               Cananor, Goa, Armus, and all the other coast of India major.</p>
            <p>In this kingdom dwell six classes of persons, that is to say: Nairs, Panicals,
               Franas, Pangelins, Macuas, and Poleas. The Nairs are the chiefs; the Panicals are the
               townspeople; these two classes live and converse together. The Franas collect the
               wine from the palm trees and the bananas. The Macuas are fishermen; and the Poleas
               sow and harvest the rice; these last always dwell in the fields, and never enter the
               city, and when it is desired to give them anything, it is placed on the ground and
               they take it. When they go along the roads they always cry out, po, po, po, that is
               take care of yourself; and we were told that a Nair who had been accidentally touched
               by a Polea, not to survive such a disgrace, had himself killed. </p>
            <p>In order to double the <span class="placeName">Cape of Good Hope</span>, we went as
               far as 42° South latitude, and we remained off that cape for nine weeks, with the
               sails struck on account of the Western and North-western gales which beat against our
               bows with fierce squalls. The <span class="placeName">Cape of Good Hope</span> is in
               34° 30' South latitude, 1600 leagues distant from the <span class="placeName">Cape of
                  Malacca</span>, and it is the largest and most dangerous cape in the world.</p>
            <p>Some of our men, and among them the sick, would have liked to land at a place
               belonging to the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> called Mozambique, both
               because the ship made much water, and because of the great cold which we suffered;
               and much more because we had nothing but rice and water for food and drink, all the
               meat of which we had made provision having putrified, for the want of salt had not
               permitted us to salt it. But the greater number of us, prizing honour more than life
               itself, decided on attempting at any risk to return to <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>. </p>
            <p>At length, by the aid of God, on the <span class="date">6th of May</span>, we passed
               that terrible cape, but we were obliged to approach it within only five leagues
               distance, or else we should never have passed it. We then sailed towards the
               north-west for two whole months without ever taking rest; and in this short time we
               lost twenty-one men between <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span> and <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Indians</span>. We made then a curious observation on throwing
               them into the sea, that was that the <span class="ethnicGroup">Christians</span>
               remained with the face turned to the sky, and the <span class="ethnicGroup"
                  >Indians</span> with the face turned to the sea. If God had not granted us
               favourable weather, we should all have perished of hunger.</p>
            <p>Constrained by extreme necessity, we decided on touching at the <span
                  class="placeName">Cape Verde Islands</span>, and on <span class="date">Wednesday
                  the 9th of July</span>, we touched at one of those islands named St. James's.
               Knowing that we were in an enemy's country, and amongst suspicious persons, on
               sending the boat ashore to get provision of victuals, we charged the seamen to say to
               the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> that we had sprung our foremast under
               the equinoctial line (although this misfortune had happened at the <span
                  class="placeName">Cape of Good Hope</span>), and that our ship was alone, because
               whilst we tried to repair it, our captain-general had gone with the other two ships
               to <span class="placeName">Spain</span>. With these good words, and giving some of
               our merchandise in exchange, we obtained two boat-loads of rice.</p>
            <p>In order to see whether we had kept an exact account of the days, we charged those
               who went ashore to ask what day of the week it was, and they were told by the <span
                  class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> inhabitants of the island that it was
               Thursday, which was a great cause of wondering to us, since with us it was only
               Wednesday. We could not persuade ourselves that we were mistaken; and I was more
               surprised than the others, since having always been in good health, I had every day,
               without intermission, written down the day that was current. But we were afterwards
               advised that there was no error on our part, since as we had always sailed towards
               the west, following the course of the sun, and had returned to the same place, we
               must have gained twenty-four hours, as is clear to any one who reflects upon it. The
               boat, having returned for rice a second time to the shore, was detained, with
               thirteen menwho were in it. As we saw that, and, from the movement in certain
               caravels, suspected that they might wish to capture us and our ship, we at once set
               sail. We afterwards learned, some time after our return, that our boat and men had
               been arrested, because one of our men had discovered the deception, and said that the
               captain-general was dead, and that our ship was the only one remaining of <span
                  class="persName">Magellan</span>'s fleet.</p>
            <p>At last, when it pleased Heaven, on <span class="date">Saturday the 6th of September
                  of the year 1522</span>, we entered the bay of San Lucar; and of sixty men who
               composed our crew when we left <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>, we were reduced
               to only eighteen,and these for the most part sick. Of the others, some died of
               hunger, some had run away at the island of <span class="placeName">Timor</span>, and
               some had been condemned to death for their crimes. </p>
            <p>From the day when we left this bay of San Lucar until our return thither, we reckoned
               that we had run more than fourteen thousand four hundred and sixty leagues, and we
               had completed going round the earth from East to West.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Monday the 8th of September</span>, we cast anchor near the mole
               of <span class="placeName">Seville</span>, and discharged all the artillery.</p>
            <p><span class="date">Tuesday</span>, we all went in shirts and barefoot, with a taper
               in our hands to visit the shrine of <span class="persName">St. Maria of
                  Victory</span>, and of <span class="persName">St. Maria de Antigua</span>.</p>
            <p>Then, leaving <span class="placeName">Seville</span>, I went to <span
                  class="placeName">Valladolid</span>, where I presented to his Sacred Majesty Don
               Carlos, neither gold nor silver, but things much more precious in the eyes of so
               great a Sovereign. I presented to him among other things, a book written by my hand
               of all the things that had occurred day by day in our voyage. I departed thence as I
               was best able, and went to Portugal, and related to <span class="persName">King
                  John</span> the things which I had seen. Returning through <span class="placeName"
                  >Spain</span>, I came to <span class="placeName">France</span>, where I presented
               a few things from the other hemisphere to Madam the Regent, mother of the most
                  Christian<span class="persName"> King Don Francis</span>. Afterwards, I turned
               towards <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, where I established for ever my abode,
               and devoted my leisure and vigils to the very illustrious and noble lord, <span
                  class="persName">Philip de Villiers Lisleadam</span>, the very worthy grand master
               of Rhodes.</p>
