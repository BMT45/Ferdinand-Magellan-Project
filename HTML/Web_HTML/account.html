            <p>ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SHIP <span class="name">"TRINITY"</span> AND HER CREW After
                she parted company with the <span class="name">"Victoria"</span>.
                From Navarrete.</p>
            <p> After the <span class="name">Victoria</span> left <span class="placeName">Tidore</span>, the crew of the
                <span class="name">Trinity</span> commenced careening their ship, and took out of her and placed
                in the store-house in <span class="placeName">Tidore</span> their goods and the guns of the
                <span class="name">Conception</span>, which they had burned, and of the
                <span class="placeName">Santiago</span>, which was lost. <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez de
                    Espinosa</span> determined to leave in charge of these goods and factory the
                accountant, <span class="persName">Juan de Campos</span>, as clerk; the <span class="rank">officer</span>,
                <span class="persName">Luis del Molino</span>; the <span class="rank">servants</span>, <span class="persName">Alonso de
                    Cota</span>, <span class="persName">Genoese</span>, and <span class="persName">Diego Arias</span>;
                and <span class="persName">Master Pedro</span>, a bombardier. Taking leave of the
                <span class="rank">King</span> of <span class="placeName">Tidore</span>, the <span class="name">Trinity</span> sailed
                thence on the <span class="date">6th of April 1522</span>, with fifty men on the
                muster-roll, and a cargo of nine hundred quintals of cloves. The <span class="name">Trinity</span>
                sailed for forty leagues to an island named <span class="placeName">Zanufo</span>, in 2 deg. 30 min. N. latitude, belonging to the <span class="rank">King</span> of
                <span class="placeName">Tidore</span>, thence to the open sea, where they calculated they
                had two thousand leagues to run to <span class="placeName">Panama</span>. In 20
                deg. they fell in with an island, where they took in a native, and continuing
                a northerly course to 42 deg., they met with a storm which lasted
                five days, and they had to cut away the castle at the prow; their poop was broken; their
                mainmast was broken in two. The crews fell sick, and they returned to seek the island
                from which they had taken the native; but, not being able to fetch it, they arrived at
                another twenty leagues distant from it. This island was named
                <span class="placeName">Mao</span>, and is to the north of the island
                <span class="placeName">Botaha</span>; they are in 12 deg. and 13
                deg. This island was three hundred leagues from the
                <span class="placeName">Moluccas</span>, and they were a month and a half in getting there;
                many of the crew died. When they arrived and anchored at the first land, which was
                <span class="placeName">Zanufo</span>, a vessel passed by which informed them that a
                fortnight after the <span class="name">Trinity</span> sailed, five or seven
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> sail had arrived at
                <span class="placeName">Terrenate</span>, whose captain was <span class="persName">Antonio de
                    Brito</span>, and that they were building a fortress there.
                <span class="persName">Barros</span> states that the first stone of this was placed by
                <span class="persName">Antonio de Brito</span>
                <span class="date">June 24th, 1522</span>. The captain of the <span class="name">Trinity</span>
                begged the people of this vessel to take a man to <span class="placeName">Terrenate</span>, who
                was <span class="persName">Bartolome Sanchez</span>, the <span class="rank">clerk</span> of the ship, by whom
                he sent a letter to the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>
                <span class="rank">captain</span>, begging him, on the part of His <span class="rank">Majesty</span>, to send him
                succour to prevent the ship being lost, for his crew was sick and reduced in number.
                <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span>, seeing that this was delayed, weighed, and came
                to anchor in the port of <span class="placeName">Benaconora</span>. <span class="persName">Simon
                    Abreu</span>, and <span class="persName">Duarte Roger</span>, <span class="rank">clerk</span> of the
                <span class="rank">King</span> of <span class="placeName">Portugal</span>'s factory, came there, with
                other people, in a caracora, and after that came a fusta and caravel, with other armed
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, who entered the <span class="name">Trinity</span>, and
                gave to the <span class="rank">captain</span> a letter from <span class="persName">Antonio de Brito</span> in
                answer to his, dated <span class="date">October 21st, 1522</span>, which only said
                that people were going to bring in his ship. By an order which they brought from Antonio
                Brito, they at once took from <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span> all the letters,
                astrolabes, quadrants, and log-books which he had made; they took the vessel and
                anchored her in the port of <span class="placeName">Talangomi</span>. There were seventeen
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> of sound and sick in the vessel, and they took
                those that were well with <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span> to the fortress, and next
                day took the sick to the hospital. <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span> complained of the
                violence done in taking that which belonged to the <span class="rank">emperor</span>, and in his
                country. They replied that he had done what the <span class="rank">emperor</span>, his
                <span class="rank">lord</span>, had commanded him; and they, what they ought to do by the
                instructions from the <span class="rank">king</span>, their <span class="rank">lord</span>. They asked him to give
                up the royal standard of <span class="placeName">Castile</span>, and he answered that he could
                not do so, neither could he defend it, since he was in their power. Upon which they drew
                up some documents before a notary; and when they discharged the cargo of the ship, he
                asked the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> to give him a certificate of what was in
                it, for him to render an account to His <span class="rank">Majesty</span>; and they replied that, if
                he asked for this often, they would give it him on a yard arm. In the fortress we found
                <span class="persName">Juan de Campos</span>, <span class="persName">Diego Arias</span>, and
                <span class="persName">Alonzo</span>, the <span class="ethnicGroup">Genoese</span>, sick, who were
                three of those who had remained in <span class="placeName">Tidore</span> with the goods of His
                <span class="rank">Majesty</span>. They said that the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> had
                knocked down the factory-house and taken the cloves and receipts for cloves which were
                paid for, and all the rigging and fittings of the ships; <span class="persName">Luis del
                    Molino</span> had fled, and <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span> called him to
                come to the fortress under safe conduct, but when in it they put him in irons;
                <span class="persName">Master Pedro</span> had died. When the ship was in
                <span class="placeName">Tidore</span>, the <span class="rank">pilot</span>, <span class="persName">Juan Lopes
                    Carvalho</span>, died on the <span class="date">14th February, 1522</span>;
                and, between sailing thence and anchoring at <span class="placeName">Benaconora</span>, there
                died in August, September, and October, thirty-one individuals, without counting three
                who ran away in the isle of Mao of the Ladrones. The twenty-one
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> of the ship and factory remained about four
                months as prisoners in <span class="placeName">Terrenate</span>, until, at the end of <span class="date">February 1523</span>, <span class="rank">Captain</span>
                <span class="persName">Antonio de Brito</span> gave them a passage to
                <span class="placeName">India</span>, sending them to the island of
                <span class="placeName">Banda</span>, which was a hundred leagues off, excepting the
                carpenter <span class="persName">Antonio</span>, and the caulker <span class="persName">Antonio
                    Basazaval</span>, whom he said that he required. The clerk of the factory,
                <span class="persName">Juan de Campos</span>, and three other
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span>, went in a junk, of which nothing was known
                nor what became of those persons. The <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> remained in
                <span class="placeName">Banda</span> about four months; from thence they were conducted to
                <span class="placeName">Java</span>, and coasting it they arrived at a city named
                <span class="placeName">Agrazue</span>. <span class="placeName">Agrazue</span> was a town of thirty
                thousand inhabitants, <span class="ethnicGroup">Mussulmans</span>, of great trade, to which
                porcelain, silks, and other <span class="ethnicGroup">Chinese</span> goods were brought from
                <span class="placeName">Borneo</span> and other parts. From <span class="placeName">Agrazue</span>
                they went to <span class="placeName">Malacca</span>, two hundred leagues distant, where
                <span class="persName">Jorge de Albuquerque</span> was <span class="rank">captain</span>. They were about
                five months at <span class="placeName">Malacca</span>. Four
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> died there at the end of <span class="date">November 1524</span>, The ship-boy, <span class="persName">Anton Moreno</span>, remained
                there, who was, they said, the slave of a sister of <span class="persName">Jorge de
                    Albuquerque</span>, and the rest went on to <span class="placeName">India</span>. They
                were twenty-five days in reaching <span class="placeName">Ceylon</span>, which was three hundred
                leagues, and they went a hundred leagues more to <span class="placeName">Cochin</span>. The
                clerk, <span class="persName">Bartolomé Sanchez</span>, and two others, went in a junk, of which
                nothing more was heard. In <span class="placeName">Cochin</span> they found that the ships for
                <span class="placeName">Portugal</span> had sailed a short time before their arrival, and
                they had to wait a year for the passage of the spice ships. After they had been ten
                months in <span class="placeName">Cochin</span>, without obtaining leave to embark, the seaman,
                <span class="persName">Leon Pancaldo</span>, and <span class="persName">Bautista Poncero</span>,
                master of the ship <span class="name">Trinity</span>, fled secretly in the ship <span class="name">Sta.
                    Catallna</span>, which left them in <span class="placeName">Mozambique</span>. There they
                were arrested and put on board the ship of <span class="name">Diego de Melo</span> to be taken to the
                <span class="rank">Governor</span> of <span class="placeName">India</span>, but contrary winds did not
                permit her departure; and, having been allowed to go ashore, <span class="persName">Bautista
                    Poncero</span> died, and <span class="persName">Leon Pancaldo</span> hid himself in the
                ship of <span class="name">Francisco Pereira</span>, which was going to Portugal. He remained hid
                till they got a hundred leagues from <span class="placeName">Mozambique</span>, When they
                arrived at <span class="placeName">Lisbon</span> they put him in prison, from which the king
                commanded him to be set free. At this time, <span class="persName">D. Vasco da Gama</span>
                arrived in <span class="placeName">India</span> as <span class="rank">Viceroy</span>, and the
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> begged for leave to embark in the ships which
                were going to <span class="placeName">Portugal</span>, but he would not give it. The
                <span class="rank">Viceroy</span> died in twenty days, and they elected in his stead <span class="persName">D.
                    Enrique de Meneses</span> governor of <span class="placeName">Goa</span>, who came to
                <span class="placeName">Cochin</span>. Two <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> died there,
                and those that remained had to wait for another year. <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span>
                had done homage and could not get away until after constant recourse and petitions to
                the <span class="rank">governor</span>, <span class="persName">D. Enrique de Meneses</span>, who gave him
                leave, as also to the seaman, <span class="persName">Gines de Mafra</span>, and to
                <span class="persName">Master Hans</span>, a bombardier, when it was known there that the
                <span class="rank">King</span> of Portugal was married to <span class="persName">Da. Catalina</span>,
                sister of His Majesty the Emperor, These three individuals left
                <span class="placeName">Cochin</span> in the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span> ships,
                and when they arrived at <span class="placeName">Lisbon</span> they put them in the
                <span class="placeName">Limoneiro</span> or public prison, where <span class="rank">Master</span>
                <span class="persName">Hans</span> died. <span class="persName">Gonzalo Gomez</span> and <span class="persName">Gines
                    de Mafra</span> remained there about seven months, until they were set free by
                letters from His <span class="rank">Majesty</span>; but Gonzalo Gomez<sup><span class="ref">1</span></sup> was set free twenty-seven
                days before <span class="persName">Gines</span>, whom they supposed to be a pilot, having found
                some log-books in his box and two other (books), which <span class="persName">Andres de San
                    Martin</span>, pilot of His <span class="rank">Majesty</span>, had made, which books and
                other writings they took, and would not return to him. From their departure from
                <span class="placeName">Terrenate</span>, in the <span class="placeName">Moluccas</span>, to
                <span class="placeName">Lisbon</span>, inclusively, there died eight individuals. What
                became of seven was unknown; two remained in the <span class="placeName">Moluccas</span>; one in
                <span class="placeName">Malacca</span>; and three reached <span class="placeName">Spain</span>,
                besides the licentiate and priest, <span class="persName">Morales</span>. <span class="persName">Gaspar
                    Correa</span> says (tome iii, p. 109):— "In this year <span class="date">1527</span>, one <span class="persName">Sebastian Gabato</span>, a
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Basque</span>, and a great pilot, sailed from
                <span class="placeName">Seville</span> as <span class="rank">captain-major</span> of two ships and a
                caravel, who was ordered by the <span class="rank">Viceroy</span> of the
                <span class="placeName">Antilles</span> to go and take in cargo at
                <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>, and recover the property of the
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span>, which he might find belonging to the ship of
                the fleet of <span class="persName">Fernan de Magalhāes</span> which put in in distress; and if
                he found any things in the possession of the <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>, he
                was to ask for them and require them from the <span class="rank">captains</span> on behalf of the <span class="rank">emperor</span>, with
                all urbanity: and if they did not choose to give them up, he was to ask for documents,
                with protests, which he was to bring to the <span class="rank">emperor</span> for him to do in the matter what
                might be for his service. This fleet sailed from <span class="placeName">Seville</span>, and never more was any news
                heard of what became of it, nor what end it had. This only was known, that this fleet
                had thus sailed this year, through other <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span>, who later arrived at <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> in
                another fleet, as I will relate further on in its place."</p>
            <p> [<span class="persName">Correa</span> relates, in his Tom. iii, cap. xiv, that <span class="persName">Charles V</span> sent a fleet of five ships in
                <span class="date">1527</span> to <span class="placeName">Maluco</span> under <span class="persName">Fray Garcia de Loaysa</span>, that only one ship under <span class="persName">Captain Martim</span>
                Inhigo reached <span class="placeName">Maluco</span>: he then describes the disputes and skirmishes between the
                <span class="ethnicGroup">Castilians</span> and <span class="ethnicGroup">Portuguese</span>.]</p>

                <sup><span class="ref">1</span></sup>This <span class="persName">Gomez</span> was the alguazil who assisted <span class="persName">Magellan</span> so much in putting down the
