                <p>In search of fame and fortune, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (c. 1480-1521) set out from Spain in 1519 with a 
                    fleet of five ships to discover a western sea route to the Spice Islands. En route he discovered what is now known as 
                    the Strait of Magellan and became the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean. The Ferdidnand Magellan Project Team
                    decided to examine and analyze the logs that were made on this voyage.</p>
