                <p>In search of fame and fortune, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (c.
                    1480-1521) set out from Spain in 1519 with a fleet of five ships to discover a
                    western sea route to the Spice Islands. En route he discovered what is now known
                    as the Strait of Magellan and became the first European to cross the Pacific
                    Ocean. </p>
                <p>The Ferdinand Magellan Project Team and decided to examine and analyze the logs
                    that were made on his voyage. We found it interesting to map the locations of
                    each log made and drawing the route the crew took, and to use the dates to
                    create a timeline to compare texts written around the dates mentioned. Through using mark up we
                 were able to pull out the most interesting information out of a few documents found and provided an interactive and
                 hopefully interesting way to view the works from that era.</p>
