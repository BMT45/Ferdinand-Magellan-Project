         TREATISE OF NAVIGATION
         
         OF THE
         
         CHEVALIER ANTONY PIGAFETTA
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>The armillary sphere, of which the author gives a drawing, serves to explain the system
            of the world according to Ptolemy, and could also serve as an astrolabe, for one sees
            at the 
            top of it a kind of handle or ring, by which to hold it suspended, as is seen in the
            above-mentioned drawing. He begins his treatise by giving us an idea of that system,
            as have done 
            all those after him, who have written of the elements of the nautical art and of pilotage.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><q>"The earth is round,"</q> he says, <q>"and remains suspended and immovable in the midst of all the celestial bodies. The
               first index fixed on two poles, the arctic and antarctic, which are 
               supposed to correspond with the poles of the earth. It runs from East to West, and
               transports with itself all the planets and stars. Besides this there is the eighth
               sphere, the 
               poles of which are at <map>23 deg. 33 min.</map>,
               <ref n="1"></ref> it runs from West to East.</q></p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><q>"It is supposed that all the circumference of the earth is divided into <map>360 degrees; and each degree is of 17 leagues and a half,</map> consequently the circumference of the earth is 
               <map>6,300 leagues</map>. <map>Land leagues are of three miles and sea leagues of four miles</map>.
               <ref n="2"></ref> "The ten circles of the armillary sphere, of which the six major pass through the
               center of the 
               earth, serve to determine the situation of countries and climates. The 
               <name>Ecliptic</name> determines the movement of the sun and the planets: the two 
               <name>Tropics</name> indicate the point to which the 
               sun declines from the equator towards the North in summer, and towards the South in
               winter. The 
               <name>Meridian</name>, always variable, because it passes through all points of the equator, 
               cutting it perpendicularly, designates the longitude, and it is on it that the latitudes
               are marked."</q></p>
         
         
         <subHeading n="1">Of Latitude.</subHeading>
         
         
         
         <p>After having well explained the armillary sphere with all its parts, and their use
            according to the system of Ptolemy, the author goes on to teach the method of 
            taking the altitude of the pole, on which the latitude is calculated; fixing the pole
            at <map>0° and the equator at 90°</map>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><q>"The Polar star,"</q> he says, <q>"is not precisely on the point corresponding to the axis of the earth; but it turns
               round it, as do all the other stars. In order to know its 
               true position with regard to the pole, it must be observed where the Guard stars 
               <ref n="3"></ref> stand. If these are on the western arm, 
               <ref n="4"></ref> the polar star stands one degree above the 
               pole: if they are on the line 
               <ref n="5"></ref> the pole star stands <map>3 deg. 30 min.</map> 
               <ref n="6"></ref> below the pole: if they are on the <map>eastern arm the pole star is one degree below the pole</map>. When one 
               wishes to take the altitude of the pole star, in whichever of the above-mentioned
               four places the 
               <name>Guard</name> stars may be, the degrees which the pole star has above the pole will 
               be subtracted from its altitude, or those which it has below the pole will be added
               to it. I have spoken in the account of the voyage of the stars of the 
               <placeName>Antarctic Pole</placeName>.</q></p>
         
         
         <p><q>"The latitude of the place may also be ascertained by the sun's altitude. 
               
               <lb>1. If you find yourself between the equinoctial and the arctic pole and the shadow
                  falls towards 
                  that pole, look how many degrees and minutes meridianal declination the sun has that
                  day; and this you will subtract from the altitude of the sun which you have taken:
                  
                  afterwards, deducting the remaining degrees from 90 deg., you will have in the residue
                  the number of degrees of North latitude, that is your distance from the equator.
               </lb>
               
               <lb>2. If the sun has a boreal declination, in such a manner that the shadow falls towards
                  the south, take the sun's declination on that day, and add it to the sun's altitude
                  
                  which you have taken, from that sum subtract 90 degs., and the remaining degrees will
                  indicate your boreal latitude.
               </lb> 
               
               <lb>3. If the sun is between the equinoctial and the antarctic, 
                  and the shadow falls towards the antarctic, observe the sun's declination for that
                  day, subtract it from the altitude taken, according to the first rule, and you will
                  have the 
                  degrees of south latitude.
               </lb> 
               
               <lb>4. If, when you and the sun are between the equinoctial and the antarctic pole, the
                  shadow falls towards the north, you will add the altitude you have 
                  taken to the sun's declination that day, and act according to the second rule. 
               </lb>
               
               <lb>5. When you have an altitude of 90 deg., you will be so many degrees distant from
                  the equator as 
                  there are degrees of the sun's declination, and if the sun has no declination you
                  will be under the equator.
               </lb> 
               
               <lb>6. If you are to the north of the equator, and the sun is in the 
                  southern signs you will look what is its declination, you will add these degrees of
                  declination to those of the altitude observed, and as many degrees as are wanting
                  from 90 
                  deg., so many will you be distant from the equinoctial. 
               </lb>
               
               <lb>7. You will do the same when you find yourself to the south of the equinoctial, whilst
                  the sun is in the northern signs.
               </lb></q></p>
         
         
         <subHeading n="2">"Of Longitude.</subHeading>
         
         
         <p><q>"<map>Longitude indicates the degrees from east to west</map>: I have considered many methods or means for ascertaining it, and I have found three
               methods 
               <ref n="7"></ref> fitting for that object. 
               The last is the most convenient for those who do not know astrology. At the present
               time the pilots content themselves with knowing the latitude; and are so proud that
               they 
               will not hear speak of longitude.</q></p>
         
         
         <p>
            <lb><q>"i. From the latitude of the moon the longitude is calculated of the place in which
                  the observation is made. The distance of the moon from the ecliptic is called its
                  latitude: 
                  the ecliptic is the path of the sun. The moon, in its movement, always increases its
                  distance until it reaches the furthest point of its distance: and thence it returns
                  back, 
                  to diminish, so to say, its latitude, until it is with the head or tail of the dragon
                  
                  <ref n="8"></ref> there it cuts the ecliptic. And since the moon, whilst it lengthens its distance
                  from 
                  the ecliptic, has more degrees towards the west than towards the east, it must necessarily
                  have more latitude on one side (of the globe) than on the other: and when the latitude
                  
                  is known, by measuring the degrees and minutes with the astrolabe, it will be known
                  whether it is found, and how far it is found towards the east or the west. But in
                  order to 
                  ascertain the longitude, you must know in what latitude the moon ought to be at that
                  same moment in the place from which you sailed, for instance, in 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName>. By knowing the 
                  latitude and longitude of the moon at 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName> in degrees and minutes, and seeing also the latitude and longitude which it has in
                  the place where you are, you will know how many 
                  hours and minutes you are distant from 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName>; and afterwards you will calculate the distance in east or west longitude.</q></lb>
            
            
            <lb><q>"ii. The moon furnishes another method for ascertaining the longitude, but that is
                  when I knew the precise hour in which the moon observed at 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName> ought to be in conjunction 
                  with a given star or planet, or ought to be in a certain opposition to the sun, of
                  which the degrees are determined: and this I can know by means of an almanack. And
                  since that 
                  happens in the east before it happens in the west, as many as may be the hours and
                  minutes that may elapse from the time when the conjunction took place at 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName>, till the time 
                  in which I observe it to take place, so much will be my longitude west of 
                  <placeName>Seville</placeName>. But if I should see the conjunction take place before the hour in which it ought
                  to happen with 
                  respect to Seville, then my distance in longitude will be east. For each hour, fifteen
                  degrees of longitude are calculated.</q>
               
               <q>"To understand this does not require any great genius. It should be borne in mind
                  that the moon has a motion opposed to the general motion of the heavens; that is,
                  it goes from 
                  west to east, and in every two hours it progresses a degree and a few minutes; and
                  since it is in the first heaven, and the stars are in the eighth, it certainly never
                  enters in 
                  conjunction with them; but sometimes it interposes itself before the rays which come
                  from them to our eye: but this does not happen at the same time to those who are at
                  Seville, 
                  and to those who are at Valencia. The annexed figure will give an idea of this, from
                  which it is seen that the ray of the star d is intercepted by the moon c for those
                  who are at 
                  a and not for those who are at b for whom it was intercepted when the moon was at
                  e.</q></lb>
            
            First Voyage Round The World Conjunction.png
            
            
            
            
            <lb><q>"iii. The compass can also supply a method, still easier, for finding the longitude
                  of the place in which you are. It is known that the compass, or the magnetised needle
                  which is 
                  in it, directs itself to a given point, because of the tendency which the loadstone
                  has towards the pole. The reason of this tendency is because the loadstone does not
                  find in the 
                  heavens any other spot in repose except the pole, and on that account directs itself
                  towards it. This is an explanation of the phenomenon which I propose; and I believe
                  it to be 
                  true, so long as experience does not inform us of some better explanation.</q>
               
               <q>"In order to know, by means of the needle, the degrees of longitude, form a large
                  circle, in which place the compass, and divide it into 360 deg.: and having placed
                  the needle at 
                  360 deg., where it indicates the arctic pole; when the needle is in repose, draw a
                  thread, which should pass from the arctic pole, pointed out by the needle to the antarctic
                  pole, 
                  and let this thread be longer than the diameter. After that take the south, which
                  you will know by the greatest altitude of the sun. Turn the compass, until the thread
                  which 
                  traverses it coincides with the direction of the meridian shade; then, from the antarctic
                  pole of the needle, with the thread which remained over, draw another thread to the
                  
                  arctic pole, that is, to the flower; 
                  <ref n="9"></ref> and you will thus find how many degrees the needle of the compass is distant from
                  the <map>meridian line</map>, that is, from the true pole. So many 
                  will be the degrees of longitude, which you will have from the place where the compass
                  begins to set itself in motion. 
                  <ref n="10"></ref> Therefore, with the more accuracy you take the true 
                  meridian so much the more exactly will you be able to ascertain the degrees of longitude.
                  And from this it may be seen that the meridian should never be taken with the compass,
                  
                  because it north-easts or north-wests, 
                  <ref n="11"></ref> as soon as it goes out of the true meridian; but take an observation of the south
                  
                  <ref n="12"></ref> with the astrolabe, and judge that it is midday 
                  when the sun is at its greatest height.</q>
               
               <q>"If it is not possible to take the sun's altitude at midday, that can be determined
                  with an hour-glass of sand, taking the hours of the night from sunset till the moment
                  of its 
                  rising. Having learned the hours of the night, you will know how many are <map>wanting of the twenty-four, and these you will divide into two equal parts</map>. When half of this has elapsed, 
                  be sure that it is midday, and that the shadow indicates to you the true meridian.
                  But since the sand clock may often be inexact, it will be better to take the sun's
                  altitude with 
                  the astrolabe by means of its mediclino. 
                  <ref n="13"></ref></q>
               
               <q>"The true meridian may also be ascertained, or rather the equinoctial line, which
                  cuts the meridian at right angles, by observing the points where the sun rises and
                  sets, and by 
                  observing how much they are distant from the equinoctial either to the north or to
                  the south. For this purpose an astrolabe is formed with the globe; that is, a circle
                  is made 
                  representing the earth's circumference, divided into 360 deg. At sunrise fix two pins
                  in the circumference, in such a manner that a line drawn from one to the other should
                  pass 
                  through the centre, and place the pins so that both should be in a line opposite the
                  sun's center. Place two other pins in the same way in the circumference when the sun
                  sets. 
                  You will thus see how much the sun declines from the equinoctial line, either to the
                  north or to the south. And as many degrees as the pins are distant from the equinoctial,
                  so 
                  many degrees the the sun's declination. Having found the sun's rising and setting,
                  you will also find the medium distance; that is, the meridian line, and afterwards
                  you will see 
                  how much the compass or magnetic needle north-easts or north-wests. You will infer
                  from this how far you are from the Fortunate islands; that is, from Tenerife towards
                  the east or 
                  the west. This method has been tried by experience.
                  <ref n="14"></ref></q></lb>
         </p>
         
         
         <subHeading n="3">"Direction of the Ship.</subHeading>
         
         
         <p><q>"If you wish to navigate to any place, you must first know its position; that is,
               its latitude and longitude. Then, by means of the compass you will point directly
               to that place. 
               And since the compass varies to east and west, you must, by the methods above described,
               ascertain its variation, and subtract or add that which is necessary, so that the
               ship's 
               head, regulated by the compass, may have the required direction.</q></p>
         
         
         <p><q>"Should the compass be lost, or if its variation east or west is not known, you may
               regulate yourself by the sun at midday. When you have fixed the meridian in such a
               manner that 
               it cuts the ship in its width, it will be easy to direct the prow wherever you wish.
               Here is an example: suppose you wish to go from north-east to south-west, place the
               chart in 
               such manner that the ship should have her head to west and the poop to the east; then
               on the circle of the winds, divided into 360, or in four times 90, fix two pins, <map>one at 45 
                  degrees between east and north, the other at 45 degrees between west and south; bring
                  the two pins on the line of the meridian by turning the ship's head for that purpose,
                  and 
                  the prow will be directed to the place to which you are going. If the pins do not
                  come in a line with the meridian, it is a sign that you are navigating in a false
                  direction</map>, and
               you must rectify the course. When you reach land, you will see that what I have said
               is true.</q></p>
         
         
         <p>"With an astrolabe made with plates, 
            <ref n="15"></ref> observations may be taken of the meridian line, the poles, and the equinoctial line,
            at any hour of the day or night, looking at the moon
            or any star; and for these, place in the middle of the astrolabe instead of the <map>verghezita or sight</map>, 
            <ref n="16"></ref> two straight bars between which you will observe the star."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Thus the method being known by which the required direction is given to the ship,
            the author teaches the method for determining the point or degree on the chart of
            the winds, 
            <ref n="17"></ref>
            to which the ship on leaving a place to go to a given country should be directed.
            For clearness, he gives some examples of this. <q>"Do you wish,"</q> he says, <q>"to go from south to north,
               or vice versâ, on the same longitude? always proceed on the same meridian. Do you
               wish to go from east to west, or vice versâ, in the same latitude? always proceed
               on the same 
               parallel. Do you wish to go from one place to another as many degrees distant in longitude
               as it is different in latitude? Then take the course of 45 degrees either to the south-west
               
               or south-east, or north-west or north-east. If the latitude is greater than the longitude,
               then add to the 45 degrees as many degrees towards the nearest pole, as the number
               of 
               degrees by which the latitude exceeds the longitude. For instance, if I wish to go
               from 
               <placeName>Cape St. Vincent</placeName> to 
               <placeName>Cape Bojador</placeName>, I reckon the degrees of longitude and those of latitude 
               to know the difference between these two capes. I find that the degrees of longitude
               are five and a half, and those of latitude are eleven, from which I subtract the degrees
               of 
               longitude and there remain <map>5 deg. 30 min</map>. Then, instead of going in the direction of from north-east to south-west (as I should
               do if the longitude were equal to the latitude], 
               I go from 5 deg. 30 min. above north-east towards north, to 5 deg. 30 min. below south-west
               towards south. If the longitude is greater than the latitude, the lesser number is
               still 
               subtracted from the greater: and the direction will be 45 deg. after deducting the
               residue. For instance, do you want to go from the island of 
               <placeName>Ferro</placeName> to 
               <placeName>Guadeloupe;</placeName> you know that the 
               first is in <map>27 deg. latitude and the second in 15 deg.</map>; then take their difference, <map>which is 12 deg.</map>: look at the map for their longitude, and you see that 
               <placeName>Ferro</placeName> is in 1 deg. and 
               
               <placeName>Guadeloupe</placeName> in 45 deg., whence their difference is 44 deg.: subtract from these the 12 deg. residue
               of latitude, and there remain 32 deg. Then you must subtract these 32 deg. from 
               45 deg., and there will remain 13 deg. Therefore your course will be from <map>north-east 13 deg. north to south-west 13 deg. south</map>.</q></p>

               the point from which he starts, or from which he takes the course, and he must fix
               the pole to the true pole observed from the sun, and not trusting to the compass,
               which north-easts

               of the magnetic needle coincided, or at least approximated to the meridian of the

               of the sixteenth century the magnetic equator or zero of deviation was very near the
               isle of Tenerife. Now it is further off, and the distance increases. M. de Bouganville
               found
