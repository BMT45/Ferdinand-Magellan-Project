                <p>Herrera (Decade iii, lib. iv, cap. 4) mentions the arrival of the Victoria, and
                    says that an accountant and thirteen Castilians had remained behind, arrested at
                    Cape Verde, and that the King of Portugal's factor sent them on to Lisbon in a
                    ship which came at that time from Calicut. Herrera then gives the names of those
                    who came in the Victoria, and who went to Court. They were—— </p>

                <p>Martin de Magallanes.</p>
                <p>Francisco Alvaro (probably Albo, the pilot).</p>
                <p>Roldan de Argote (from whom must be named the mountain, which in the Strait of
                    Magellan, is now called the Campaña de Roldan). Juan Sebastian del Cano. This
                    number, 31, will agree with Pigafetta's 13, who remained at Cape Verde, and 18
                    who landed from the Victoria. Sebastian del Cano was very well received by the
                    emperor, and Herrera mentions the safe arrival of some of the Molucca Indians:
                    "One of whom," he says, "was so sharp, that the first thing he did was to
                    inquire how many reals a ducat was worth, and a real how many maravedises, and
                    how much pepper was given for a maravedi; and he went from shop to shop to get
                    information of the value of spices, and with this he gave cause that he did not
                    return to his country, although the others returned." This probably means that
                    he was not allowed to return, lest he should raise the price of spices in the
                    Molucca Islands. </p>
